# Panel 3 — "THE SCALE" (Portrait, High Resolution)

## Image Generation Prompt

Create a high-resolution portrait-orientation (2:3 aspect ratio, minimum 2400×3600px) technical infographic panel with the following precise visual specifications and content layout. This is panel 3 of a triptych — it covers platform metrics, economic valuation, deployment topologies, technology stack, roadmap, and operational maturity. No content from panels 1 or 2 appears here.

### GLOBAL VISUAL STYLE

**Background:** Deep navy-black (#0a0e1a) with subtle star field particles (tiny white/blue dots at 5-8% opacity), faint amber-gold nebula accents in upper-right and lower-left corners, barely-visible orthographic grid lines (#1a2040 at 3% opacity). Same deep-space engineering schematic feel as panels 1 and 2.

**Color Palette (strict — identical across all three panels):**
- Primary: Cyan/teal (#00e5ff, #00bcd4)
- Accent 1: Magenta/hot pink (#ff4081, #e040fb)
- Accent 2: Lime/green (#76ff03, #69f0ae)
- Accent 3: Amber/gold (#ffd740, #ffab40)
- Accent 4: Deep purple (#b388ff, #7c4dff)
- Text: White (#ffffff) at 90%/60% opacity
- Borders: 1.5px with 4px glow at 30%

**Typography, Containers, Connectors, Icons:** Identical specs to panels 1 and 2.

#### ZONE C — ECONOMIC VALUATION (next 20% of canvas)

**Section header:** "COCOMO II ECONOMIC VALUATION — REPLACEMENT COST MODEL" in amber, ALL CAPS, thin amber underline.

**Left half (55%) — Valuation breakdown:**

**Large central container with double amber border:**

**Header:** "ECOSYSTEM REPLACEMENT VALUE" with diamond/gem icon

**Giant number centered:** "$65M" in amber, 96pt, with strong gold glow effect
**Subtext:** "median estimate (defensible range: $55M — $75M)" in white at 70%

**Below the number — breakdown table in a grid:**

| Substrate | SLOC | Share | Value |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| VisionClaw | 274K | 56.7% | $37M |
| agentbox | 104K | 21.5% | $14M |
| nostr-rust-forum | 49K | 10.1% | $6.5M |
| solid-pod-rs | 39K | 8.0% | $5.2M |
| dreamlab-ai-website | 18K | 3.7% | $2.4M |
| Docs & specs | 126K lines | — | $2.5M |

Render this as a clean table with thin cyan row separators and amber header row.

**Below table:** Two small stat pills:
- "3,446 person-months of embedded effort"
- "Equivalent: 82 FTEs × 3.5 years"

**Right half (45%) — Language composition:**

**Donut/ring chart** (or stacked horizontal bar chart if donut is too complex) showing language breakdown by SLOC:

- **Rust: 352K (73%)** — large cyan segment, largest
- **TypeScript: 139K (29%)** — magenta segment (note: percentages are of code only, and overlap because each substrate has its own mix)
- **JavaScript: 73K (15%)** — green segment
- **Python: 60K (12%)** — purple segment
- **Shell: 25K (5%)** — white/gray segment
- **CUDA: 7K (1.5%)** — amber segment (small but highlighted with special callout arrow: "Highest effort-per-line in the ecosystem")

Actually render as a **horizontal stacked bar chart** — one bar per substrate, each bar segmented by language with color coding. This is cleaner than a donut for 6 languages × 5 substrates.

**Below chart:**
- "Total: 482,807 SLOC (logical source lines, 0.70× raw)"
- Small callout box: "AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT: 10-15× productivity multiplier. ~18 months wall-clock representing $65M replacement value."

### RENDERING NOTES

- The $65M number in Zone C is the visual anchor of this panel — make it unmissable, large, glowing
- The roadmap timeline (Zone F) should read clearly left-to-right with clear phase progression
- Metric cards (Zone B) should feel like a mission control dashboard — clean, grid-aligned, scannable
- Technology stack badges (Zone D) should be dense but orderly — think package.json visualised
- Deployment topology diagrams (Zone E) are intentionally simple/abstract — just boxes and lines showing the pattern
- All gauge bars (Zone G) should be smooth gradient fills, not stepped
- Maintain identical spacing, typography, and color conventions as panels 1 and 2
- Portrait orientation: 2400×3600px (2:3 ratio)
- Every text element legible at print resolution — no decorative blur
