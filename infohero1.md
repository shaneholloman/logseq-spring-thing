# Panel 1 — "THE ECOSYSTEM" (Portrait, High Resolution)

## Image Generation Prompt

Create a high-resolution portrait-orientation (2:3 aspect ratio, minimum 2400×3600px) technical infographic panel with the following precise visual specifications and content layout. This is panel 1 of a triptych — it covers the ecosystem landscape, identity layer, and value proposition. No content from panels 2 or 3 appears here.

### GLOBAL VISUAL STYLE

**Background:** Deep navy-black (#0a0e1a) with subtle star field particles (tiny white/blue dots at 5-8% opacity), faint blue-purple nebula clouds in upper-right and lower-left corners, barely-visible orthographic grid lines (#1a2040 at 3% opacity) creating a technical blueprint feel. The overall impression is deep space meets engineering schematic.

**Color Palette (strict):**
- Primary: Cyan/teal (#00e5ff, #00bcd4) — used for borders, primary text headers, infrastructure elements
- Accent 1: Magenta/hot pink (#ff4081, #e040fb) — used for identity/security concepts, DID elements
- Accent 2: Lime/green (#76ff03, #69f0ae) — used for data flow arrows, active states, success indicators
- Accent 3: Amber/gold (#ffd740, #ffab40) — used for metrics, numbers, warning states
- Accent 4: Deep purple (#b388ff, #7c4dff) — used for agent/AI elements, secondary containers
- Text: White (#ffffff) at 90% opacity for body, 60% opacity for secondary labels
- Borders: 1.5px strokes with outer glow (4px blur, 30% opacity of stroke color)

**Typography:**
- Title: Bold condensed sans-serif (like Rajdhani, Orbitron, or Exo 2), uppercase, with subtle outer glow matching text color
- Section headers: ALL CAPS, 18-22pt equivalent, with a thin colored underline extending 60% of container width
- Body text: Clean technical sans-serif (like Inter, Source Sans Pro), 9-11pt equivalent, white at 85% opacity
- Metric numbers: Extra-bold, 48-72pt equivalent, amber/gold with subtle glow
- Labels: Monospace (like JetBrains Mono), 7-8pt, white at 55% opacity

**Containers:** Rounded rectangles (8px radius) with thin neon borders (1.5px). Interior fill is background color at 60% opacity with very subtle gradient (slightly lighter at top). Some containers have a faint inner glow along the top edge.

**Connectors:** Thin dashed or dotted lines (1px) in muted versions of the palette colors, with small triangular arrowheads (4px). Lines route orthogonally (horizontal/vertical with 90-degree bends), never diagonal.

**Icons:** Outlined geometric style, single-color, 24-32px. Minimalist technical icons — not emoji, not filled, not photorealistic. Think Lucide, Phosphor, or Tabler icon style.

### RENDERING NOTES

- Every text element must be crisp and legible — no blur, no decorative illegibility
- Maintain 12-16px minimum padding inside all containers
- Leave 8-12px gutters between adjacent containers
- All connector lines must be clean and orthogonal — no spaghetti
- The overall density should feel like a technical reference poster, not a marketing brochure
- No photographs, no 3D renders, no gradients on text — flat neon on dark
- The cosmic background should be subtle enough that all foreground elements read clearly
- Portrait orientation: width roughly 2400px, height roughly 3600px (2:3 ratio)
