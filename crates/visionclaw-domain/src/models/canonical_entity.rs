//! Canonical entity model — the single source of truth for a knowledge graph
//! page or ontology entity, distilled from a file's JSON-LD blocks.
//!
//! Every page in `mainKnowledgeGraph/pages/` is **one** canonical entity. The
//! file's JSON-LD blocks describe that entity in two slices:
//!
//! - `@type: "Page"` — identity (`vc:slug`), title, wikilinks, provenance.
//! - `@type: "Class"` (optional) — formal ontology axioms: `subClassOf`,
//!   `hasPart`, `enables`, etc.
//!
//! A canonical entity collapses both slices into a single record keyed by
//! `vc:slug` — the authoritative identifier produced by the upstream uplift
//! pipeline. Node identity in the graph derives from `hash(slug)`, so every
//! consumer of an entity (page node, edge target, wikilink target) resolves
//! to the same `u32` node id without coincidence.
//!
//! See ADR-090 Phase B (JSON-LD-first ingest) for the rationale.
