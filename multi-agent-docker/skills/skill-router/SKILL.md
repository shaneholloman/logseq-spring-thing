# /route — Unified Skill Dispatcher

Describe your task. Get routed to the right skill. You don't need to know 88 skills — just say what you need.

## Usage

```
/route [describe what you need]
```

Examples:
- `/route fix the login bug and add tests`
- `/route generate a Wardley map of our infrastructure`
- `/route audit this UI for accessibility`
- `/route research competitor pricing for UK market`
- `/route harden this Linux server for SOC2`
- `/route 123 Main St, Brooklyn — site analysis and zoning`
- `/route make a podcast about our architecture`

## On Start

1. Read the user's input — everything after `/route`.
2. Classify intent against the routing table below.
3. If clear match → invoke that skill immediately.
4. If ambiguous → ask exactly ONE clarifying question, then route.
5. If multi-skill → state the composition plan, then invoke the first skill.

## Routing Rules

### Rule 1: Clear match → dispatch immediately
State which skill handles the request in one sentence, then invoke it.

### Rule 2: Ambiguous → ask ONE question
If the intent could go to 2+ skills, ask exactly one clarifying question. Then route.

### Rule 3: Multi-skill composition → state the plan
If the task spans multiple skills, state the sequence and invoke the first one.
Example: "Starting with `perplexity-research` for competitor data, then `report-builder` for the analysis document."

### Rule 4: No match → show condensed menu
```
I don't have a specific skill for that. Here's what I cover:

• Code: /route [bug fix / feature / refactor]
• Research: /route [web search / URL analysis / NotebookLM]
• Design: /route [UI/UX / design audit / typography]
• Docs: /route [report / LaTeX / diagrams / Wardley map]
• Media: /route [image / video / 3D / AI art]
• DevOps: /route [GitHub / CI-CD / release]
• Security: /route [hardening / compliance / audit]
• Architecture: /route [review / first-principles / entropy lens]
• AEC: /route [site planning / zoning / sustainability]

Or browse the full inventory: see SKILL-DIRECTORY.md
```

### Rule 5: Just `/route` with no arguments → show condensed menu

## What This Skill Does NOT Do
- It does not execute tasks. It routes to the skill that does.
- It does not override skill-internal logic.
- It does not ask more than one clarifying question.
