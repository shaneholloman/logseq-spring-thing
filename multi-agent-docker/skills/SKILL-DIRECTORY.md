> **Don't know which skill?** Use `/route [describe your task]` — the unified dispatcher
> classifies your intent and routes you automatically. Only read further if you want to
> understand the full routing logic.

Answer these questions in order. Stop at the first match.

```
Q0: Unsure which skill handles your task?
    --> /route [describe task]  (skill-router — intelligent dispatcher for all 89 skills)

Q1: Is the task about an EXISTING skill that is deprecated?
    YES --> Use its replacement (see Deprecated table above)

Q2: What is the primary domain?

    [A] CODE DEVELOPMENT (write, refactor, test, review code)
    [B] GITHUB OPERATIONS (PRs, issues, releases, workflows, multi-repo)
    [C] MULTI-AGENT / SWARM COORDINATION
    [D] RESEARCH, WEB, and CONTENT (fetch URLs, search web, summarise, NotebookLM)
    [E] DOCUMENTS and REPORTS (LaTeX, diagrams, docs validation)
    [F] MEDIA (image, video, audio, 3D, AI generation)
    [G] BROWSER AUTOMATION (scrape, test UI, debug web apps)
    [H] AI/ML MODEL WORK (train, deploy, reason)
    [I] MEMORY and LEARNING (store, search, vector DB, RL)

    [O] AEC / BUILDING ARCHITECTURE (site planning, zoning, sustainability, materials)
```

### [A] Code Development

#### Methodology Disambiguation

Four methodology skills exist at different phases of the development lifecycle. **They are sequential, not competing**:

```
PHASE 1 — SPECIFICATION
  You have a PRD and need all docs generated                → prd2build
    (outputs: 8 spec files, 27+ ADRs, 11 DDD files, 20+ tasks)
    (optional --build flag hands off to build-with-quality)

  You need artifact traceability + sprint scaffolding       → bhil-methodology
    (outputs: PRD-NNN → SPEC-NNN → ADR-NNN → TASK-NNN chain)
    (does NOT execute code — specification-only)

PHASE 2 — IMPLEMENTATION
  Systematic 5-phase development (spec→pseudo→arch→refine→complete)  → sparc-methodology
    (17 modes; delegates to sub-agents per phase)

  Multi-file feature with quality gates, TDD, coverage             → build-with-quality
    (111+ agents; dev + QE unified; SONA learning; truth scoring)

PHASE 3 — VERIFICATION
  Truth-score verification only, no full pipeline needed    → verification-quality
    (0.0–1.0 truth scoring, automatic rollback at 0.95)
```

**Common flow**: `prd2build` → (docs) → `bhil-methodology` → (traceability artifacts) → `build-with-quality` → (code + tests) → `verification-quality` → (confidence score)

#### Complexity Decision Tree

```

    +-- Need artifact traceability chain (PRD→SPEC→ADR→TASK) across a sprint
    |   --> bhil-methodology  [specification-only, no code execution]
    |
    +-- Multi-file feature with quality gates, TDD, coverage, 111+ agents
    |   --> build-with-quality
    |
    +-- Systematic multi-phase (spec -> pseudo -> arch -> refine -> complete)
    |   --> sparc-methodology
    |
    +-- Just need truth-score verification and rollback safety
    |   --> verification-quality
    |

```

### [D] Research, Web, and Content

## Overlap Analysis and Recommendations

### Overlapping Skill Groups

**1. Perplexity**: `perplexity` is deprecated; `perplexity-research` is the active replacement. Complete.

**2. Swarm Orchestration**: `swarm-orchestration` is deprecated; `swarm-advanced` is the active replacement. Complete.

**3. AgentDB Optimization**: `agentdb-optimization` is deprecated; merged into `agentdb-vector-search`. Complete.

**4. ReasoningBank + Pair Programming**: Both `reasoningbank-agentdb`, `reasoningbank-intelligence`, and `pair-programming` are deprecated; all merged into `build-with-quality`. Complete.

**5. AgentDB Learning → Advanced**: `agentdb-learning` deprecated; RL Plugins section added to `agentdb-advanced`. All 9 algorithms accessible from a single skill. Complete.

**6. Bencium Creative Consolidation**: `bencium-innovative-ux-designer` and `bencium-impact-designer` deprecated; merged into `bencium-creative` with `--design`/`--build` modes. Complete.

**7. Browser Tools (4 active + 1 meta)**: Well-differentiated. `browser-automation` serves as the meta-skill decision layer. No merge needed.

**8. V3 Implementation Skills (9 archived)**: All archived. Serve as reference only. Could be moved to a `/skills/archive/` subdirectory to reduce clutter.

**9. Development Meta-Skills**: `build-with-quality` vs `sparc-methodology` -- distinct. BWQ focuses on quality engineering with 111+ agents; SPARC focuses on phased methodology. Both are needed.

**10. Flow Nexus Trio**: `flow-nexus-platform`, `flow-nexus-neural`, `flow-nexus-swarm` -- well-separated by concern (platform admin vs ML training vs swarm deployment). No merge needed.

### Potential Future Consolidation

- **AgentDB family** (4 skills): Consider a meta-skill `agentdb` that routes to the correct sub-skill, similar to how `browser-automation` routes browser tools.
- **GitHub family** (5 skills): Consider a meta-skill `github` that routes based on the operation type.
