## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`keyword-research`** — new skill for keyword discovery, intent classification, difficulty assessment, opportunity scoring, and topic clustering. Includes reference materials for intent taxonomy, prioritization framework, cluster templates, and example reports.
- **`meta-tags-optimizer`** — new skill for creating and optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph, and Twitter Card tags with A/B test variations and CTR analysis. Includes reference materials for tag formulas, CTR benchmarks, and code templates.
- **`schema-markup-generator`** — new skill for generating JSON-LD structured data (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product, LocalBusiness, etc.) with validation guidance and rich result eligibility checks. Includes reference materials for schema templates, decision tree, and validation guide.
- **`geo-content-optimizer`** — new skill for optimizing content to appear in AI-generated responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude). Scores GEO readiness and applies citation, authority, and structure optimization techniques. Includes reference materials for AI citation patterns, GEO techniques, and quotable content examples.

### Changed
- **README.md** — updated with documentation for all 4 new skills, expanded install instructions and directory tree

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-27

### Security
- **Predictable /tmp paths** — `analyze_gsc.py` and `list_gsc_sites.py` now use `gsc_analysis_{uid}.json` / `gsc_sites_{uid}.json` via `tempfile.gettempdir()` + `os.getuid()`, preventing cross-user data exposure on multi-user systems
- **`.gstack/` gitignored** — local security audit reports excluded from git history
- **Test dependency lockfile** — added `requirements-test.lock` (pip-compiled) to pin test dependencies and prevent supply-chain drift

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`preflight.py`** — pre-flight check that runs before any GSC operations; detects gcloud with OS-specific install instructions (Homebrew / apt / dnf / curl / winget), auto-triggers `gcloud auth` browser flow if no ADC credentials found
- **`setup.py`** — cross-platform Python equivalent of `./setup` for Windows users who can't run bash; falls back to directory junctions (no admin rights required) when symlinks are unavailable
- **Phase 0 in SKILL.md** — preflight step added before GSC access check; also restores the "skip GSC → Phase 5" escape hatch for technical-only audits

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis/SKILL.md`** — Phase 1 simplified (error cases now handled by preflight); Phase 1 bash block is self-contained (no shell variable leak from Phase 0)

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **README demo section** — "See It Work" example conversation showing end-to-end `/seo-analysis` flow for clearer onboarding

### Changed
- **Auto-upgrade on every skill use** — removed the 4-option prompt (Yes / Always / Not now / Never); updates now apply automatically whenever `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` is detected
- **Update check frequency** — reduced UP_TO_DATE cache TTL from 60 min to 5 min so checks run on nearly every skill invocation
- **Zero-dependency GSC auth** — removed `google-auth` Python package requirement; reverts 0.4.1 approach; scripts now call `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token` directly via subprocess and use stdlib `urllib` for HTTP, eliminating the `pip install` setup step
- **`gsc_auth.py` removed** — auth logic inlined in `list_gsc_sites.py` and `analyze_gsc.py`; simpler, no shared module
- **SKILL.md Phase 1** — GSC setup instructions updated to reflect the simpler auth flow

### Security
- **Predictable /tmp paths** — GSC output files now use `gsc_analysis_{uid}.json` and `gsc_sites_{uid}.json` instead of shared paths, preventing cross-user data exposure on multi-user systems
- **`.gstack/` gitignored** — security audit reports are now excluded from git commits
- **Test dependency lockfile** — added `requirements-test.lock` (pip-compiled) to pin exact versions and prevent supply-chain drift

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **GSC quota project header** — replaced raw `urllib` HTTP calls with `google-auth` library (`AuthorizedSession`), which automatically sends the `x-goog-user-project` header required for ADC user credentials; this was the root cause of 403 errors during onboarding
- **Auto-detect quota project** — scripts now read `quota_project_id` from ADC credentials and fall back to `gcloud config get-value project` if missing, eliminating the manual `set-quota-project` step

### Changed
- **Shared auth module** — extracted `gsc_auth.py` with `get_credentials()`, `get_session()`, and `_ensure_quota_project()` to eliminate duplicated auth logic between `list_gsc_sites.py` and `analyze_gsc.py`
- **SKILL.md Phase 1** — streamlined GSC setup instructions from ~50 lines to ~25 lines for faster onboarding and lower token usage
- **gsc_setup.md** — updated setup guide to reflect 2-step process (`pip install google-auth` + `gcloud auth application-default login`) and documented new troubleshooting entries

### Added
- **`google-auth` dependency** — new pip requirement for proper Google API authentication
- **4 new unit tests** for `_ensure_quota_project()` covering: already-set, auto-detect from gcloud, gcloud not found, gcloud returns empty

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`content-writer` skill** — standalone SEO content creation, directly invocable without running a full SEO audit
  - Handles three jobs: new blog posts, new landing pages, and improving existing pages
  - 6-step workflow: determine job → gather context → read guidelines → research & plan → write → quality gate
  - Follows Google's E-E-A-T and Helpful Content guidelines via shared reference doc
  - Outputs publication-ready content with SEO metadata, JSON-LD structured data, internal linking plan, and publishing checklist
  - Smart content type detection from user intent (informational → blog, transactional → landing page)
- **`content-writing.md` reference doc** — single source of truth for Google content best practices (E-E-A-T framework, helpful content signals, blog/landing page templates, search intent matching, on-page SEO checklist, anti-patterns including AI content pitfalls)
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 7** — optional content generation after audit; spawns up to 5 content agents in parallel when content gaps are identified, each reading the shared `content-writing.md` guidelines

### Changed
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — expanded with detailed SKILL.md structure, script requirements, reference file guidelines, and skill ideas table
- **README.md** — added `content-writer` to skills table and updated project description

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Python test suite** — full pytest infrastructure under `test/` replacing the prior TypeScript/Bun approach; no build step required
  - `test/unit/` — 42 fast unit tests (stdlib only, no API calls); covers date math, GSC data processing, report structure, and skill SKILL.md content validation
  - `test/test_skill_e2e.py` — E2E skill tests gated behind `EVALS=1`; uses mock `gcloud` + mock `analyze_gsc.py` fixture to run the full skill workflow without real credentials
  - `test/test_skill_llm_eval.py` — LLM-as-judge quality evals gated behind `EVALS=1`; scores report clarity, actionability, and phase coverage on a 1–5 scale
  - `test/test_skill_routing_e2e.py` — routing evals verify the skill triggers on SEO prompts and stays silent on unrelated requests
  - `test/helpers/` — session runner (spawns `claude -p --output-format stream-json`), LLM judge, eval store, and diff-based test selection
  - `test/fixtures/` — mock gcloud binary, mock analyze_gsc.py, and sample GSC JSON fixture data
  - `conftest.py` — root-level pytest config for import path setup
  - `requirements-test.txt` — minimal test dependencies

### Fixed
- **Routing tests** — added harness failure guard; `should-not-trigger` tests no longer silently pass when the subprocess times out or crashes
- **Env isolation** — test subprocess now strips `ANTHROPIC_*` vars (in addition to `CLAUDE_*`) to prevent `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` from redirecting evals to an unintended endpoint
- **LLM judge retry** — exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s) replaces single-retry on rate limit
- **Mock gcloud** — removed fall-through to real `gcloud` binary that caused infinite recursion when mock was first in PATH
- **`.gitignore`** — restored credential patterns (`credentials.json`, `token.json`, `.env`, etc.) accidentally dropped in initial commit

## [0.2.3] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md — removed skill ideas table and verbose guidelines, kept essentials for getting started

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Rewrote README intro for clarity and power — headline now communicates that Toprank analyzes, recommends, and fixes SEO issues directly in your repo

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Autoupdate system** — skills now check GitHub for new versions on every invocation
  - `bin/toprank-update-check` — fetches `VERSION` from GitHub with 60-min cache; outputs `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>` or nothing
  - `bin/toprank-config` — read/write `~/.toprank/config.yaml`; supports `update_check`, `auto_upgrade` keys
  - `toprank-upgrade/SKILL.md` — upgrade skill with inline and standalone flows, snooze (24h/48h/7d backoff), auto-upgrade mode, changelog diff
  - Preamble in `seo-analysis` and auto-inject via `setup` for all future skills
  - `bin/preamble.md` — single source of truth for the preamble template
- `VERSION` file — tracks current release for update checks

### Fixed
- `toprank-update-check`: validate local VERSION format before writing cache; exit after `JUST_UPGRADED` to prevent dual stdout output; move `mkdir -p` to top of script
- `setup`: atomic SKILL.md writes via temp file + `os.replace()`; add `pipefail` to catch silent Python errors
- `toprank-upgrade`: clear stale `.bak` before vendored upgrade to prevent collision

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 1** — replaced two-step auth check (token print + separate site list) with single `list_gsc_sites.py` call that tests auth, scopes, and GSC access in one shot; added distinct handling for each failure mode (wrong account, wrong scopes, API not enabled, gcloud not installed)
- **`seo-analysis` script paths** — replaced hardcoded `~/.claude/skills/seo-analysis/scripts/` with a `find`-based `SKILL_SCRIPTS` lookup that works for Claude Code, Codex, and custom install paths; added guard for empty result so missing installs fail with a clear error instead of a confusing path error
- **`seo-analysis` property selection** — added explicit rule to prefer domain property (`sc-domain:example.com`) over URL-prefix when both exist for the same site
- **`gsc_setup.md`** — moved "Which Google Account" guidance to top (most common failure cause); replaced broken `oauth_setup.py` Option B with Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, RPM) and Windows install instructions; fixed deprecated `apt-key` with `gpg --dearmor` for Debian 12+/Ubuntu 24.04+; expanded troubleshooting to cover `insufficient_scope` 403s

### Fixed
- **`list_gsc_sites.py`** — unhandled `FileNotFoundError` when gcloud is not installed now shows a clean error message; added `URLError` handling for network failures (DNS, TLS, proxy)
- **`analyze_gsc.py`** — same `FileNotFoundError` and `URLError` fixes
- **`gsc_setup.md`** — removed reference to `oauth_setup.py` which did not exist
- **`seo-analysis` SKILL.md** — corrected error-branch description from "Python traceback" to "ERROR: gcloud not found" to match the actual script output

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **README intro** — rewritten to lead with user outcome ("Finally know what to do about your SEO") and emphasize zero-risk install; blockquote examples now show real questions users would type

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`seo-analysis` skill** — comprehensive SEO audit powered by Google Search Console
  - Phase 1: GSC API setup detection and guided auth via `gcloud` Application Default Credentials
  - Phase 2: Auto-detect site URL from website repo (`package.json`, `next.config.js`, `astro.config.*`, etc.) or prompt for URL
  - Phase 3: Data collection — top queries, top pages, position buckets (1–3, 4–10, 11–20, 21+), CTR opportunities, 28-day period comparison, device split
  - Phase 4a: Search Console analysis — quick wins, content gaps, traffic drops
  - Phase 4b: Technical SEO audit — indexability, meta tags, heading structure, structured data, performance signals
  - Phase 5: Structured report with executive summary, traffic snapshot, and 30-day action plan
- `scripts/list_gsc_sites.py` — list all GSC properties for the authenticated account
