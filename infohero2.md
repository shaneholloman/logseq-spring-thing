# Panel 2 — "THE ENGINE" (Portrait, High Resolution)

## Image Generation Prompt

Create a high-resolution portrait-orientation (2:3 aspect ratio, minimum 2400×3600px) technical infographic panel with the following precise visual specifications and content layout. This is panel 2 of a triptych — it covers the core technology, data pipelines, and runtime architecture. No content from panels 1 or 3 appears here.

### GLOBAL VISUAL STYLE

**Background:** Deep navy-black (#0a0e1a) with subtle star field particles (tiny white/blue dots at 5-8% opacity), faint teal-cyan nebula wisps in upper-left and lower-right corners, barely-visible orthographic grid lines (#1a2040 at 3% opacity) creating a technical blueprint feel. The overall impression is deep space meets engineering schematic.

**Color Palette (strict — identical to panels 1 and 3):**
- Primary: Cyan/teal (#00e5ff, #00bcd4) — borders, primary text headers, infrastructure elements
- Accent 1: Magenta/hot pink (#ff4081, #e040fb) — security/identity concepts
- Accent 2: Lime/green (#76ff03, #69f0ae) — data flow arrows, active states, success indicators
- Accent 3: Amber/gold (#ffd740, #ffab40) — metrics, numbers, warning states
- Accent 4: Deep purple (#b388ff, #7c4dff) — agent/AI elements, secondary containers
- Text: White (#ffffff) at 90% opacity for body, 60% opacity for secondary labels
- Borders: 1.5px strokes with outer glow (4px blur, 30% opacity of stroke color)

**Typography:** (identical to panel 1)
- Title: Bold condensed sans-serif, uppercase, subtle outer glow
- Section headers: ALL CAPS, 18-22pt, thin colored underline at 60% width
- Body: Clean technical sans-serif, 9-11pt, white at 85%
- Metrics: Extra-bold, 48-72pt, amber/gold with glow
- Labels: Monospace, 7-8pt, white at 55%

**Containers, Connectors, Icons:** Same specs as panel 1 — rounded rectangles (8px radius), 1.5px neon borders, orthogonal dashed connectors, outlined geometric icons 24-32px.

### RENDERING NOTES

- The actor mesh diagram (Zone B) is the visual centrepiece — give it generous space and make the hierarchy clear
- GPU pipeline (Zone C) should read strictly left-to-right like a factory production line
- All monospace code snippets should be in a slightly darker sub-container (#0d1220) with 1px border
- Maintain consistent 12-16px padding, 8-12px gutters throughout
- Every text element must be crisp and legible at print resolution
- No photographs, no 3D renders — flat neon on dark, technical poster aesthetic
- Portrait orientation: 2400×3600px (2:3 ratio)
