# VisionClaw Actor System Hierarchy

VisionClaw's Rust backend coordinates 23 specialised Actix actors under a hierarchical supervision tree. Actors handle all concurrent concerns — WebSocket client management, GPU physics coordination, graph state, semantic processing, GitHub ingestion, agent monitoring, and task orchestration — without shared mutable state. Communication is exclusively via typed asynchronous messages.

> **Note**: `GraphServiceActor` no longer exists as an active component. It was decomposed into the current 21-actor hierarchy and replaced by CQRS handlers backed by Neo4j. Any reference to `GraphServiceActor` in older documentation is historical.

---

## 1. Overview

The actor system is built on Actix-Web's arbiter model. Each actor owns private state and processes one message at a time from its mailbox. Concurrency arises from many actors running in parallel across the Tokio thread pool. The supervision tree ensures failures are isolated: a CUDA OOM in `ForceComputeActor` restarts only the physics sub-actors, not the graph state or WebSocket connections.

Actors serve as the **Presentation Layer** of the hexagonal architecture. They receive external inputs (HTTP requests, WebSocket messages, timer ticks, GPU callbacks) and translate them into domain operations by dispatching commands and queries through the CQRS bus. Actors never access Neo4j or the GPU directly — they go through port trait adapters.

    note over FC: Reheat factor 1.0 applied;<br/>gradual decay over ~10 steps
```

---

## 5. Supervision Strategies

| Supervisor | Strategy | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `AppSupervisor` | OneForOne | Top-level actors are independent; a settings failure must not restart the physics pipeline |
| `GraphServiceSupervisor` | OneForOne | `GraphStateActor` and `GraphUpdateActor` are independent |
| `PhysicsOrchestratorActor` | AllForOne (for GPU children) | GPU actors share CUDA device state; a CUDA OOM in one actor corrupts shared buffers |
| `ResourceSupervisor` | Restart with backoff | GPU init failures are retried before escalation |
| `PhysicsSupervisor` | AllForOne | Physics state is interdependent across force actors; restarts all 5 children when any fails since they share `SharedGPUContext` (upgraded from OneForOne in ADR-031 sprint) |
| `AnalyticsSupervisor` | OneForOne | Analytics algorithms are independent; clustering failure must not restart PageRank |
| `GraphAnalyticsSupervisor` | OneForOne | Path algorithms are independent |

### Restart Policy

All supervisors use exponential backoff with:

```rust
SupervisorStrategy::OneForOne {
    max_restarts: 3,
    within: Duration::from_secs(10),
    backoff: BackoffStrategy::Exponential {
        initial_interval: Duration::from_millis(500),
        max_interval: Duration::from_secs(5),
        multiplier: 2.0,
    }
}
```

If an actor exceeds 3 restarts in 10 seconds, the failure escalates to its parent supervisor.

### Actor Respawning via ActorFactory

`SupervisorActor` uses a type-erased `ActorFactory` trait to respawn child actors on failure. Each supervisor stores a `Box<dyn ActorFactory>` per child, enabling real actor recreation (with full `started()` lifecycle) rather than simple address re-registration. This ensures GPU actors re-execute their self-init sequence on respawn.

### Graceful Shutdown

Actors support the `InitiateGracefulShutdown` message, which triggers a drain-before-stop sequence: the actor finishes processing its current mailbox, flushes pending state (e.g., position checkpoints, cache writes), and then calls `ctx.stop()`. This prevents data loss during planned restarts or rolling deployments.

### Escalation Wiring

`GraphServiceSupervisor` sends `SetParentSupervisor` to its children during `started()`, wiring the escalation chain so that child actors can report unrecoverable failures to their parent supervisor. This message carries the parent's `Addr<SupervisorActor>`, enabling children to escalate without requiring a global actor registry.

---

## 6. Actor Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created
    Created --> Starting : Actix spawns actor
    Starting --> Running : started() hook completes
    Running --> Processing : Message dequeued
    Processing --> Running : Handler returns
    Processing --> Error : Handler panics / returns Err
    Error --> Restarting : Supervisor decides restart
    Restarting --> Starting : New instance created
    Running --> Stopping : ctx.stop() or supervisor stop
    Stopping --> Stopped : stopping() + stopped() hooks
    Stopped --> [*]
```

**Lifecycle hooks**:

- `started()` — initialise resources, start timer intervals (e.g., `GraphStateActor` starts 60-second checkpointing interval here)
- `stopping()` — begin cleanup, flush pending state
- `stopped()` — release CUDA buffers, close DB connections, deregister from pub/sub

**Warm-up window** (`ForceComputeActor`): 600 frames (~10 seconds at 60 FPS). Physics is considered settled only after this window. The periodic full broadcast (every 300 iterations) ensures clients that connect after warm-up and convergence still receive positions.

---

## 7. GPU Supervisor Hierarchy

The GPU subsystem uses a 4-supervisor pattern under `GPUManagerActor`, providing fault isolation zones that prevent analytics failures from affecting physics.

```mermaid

    subgraph "GPU Manager"
        GM["GPUManagerActor<br/>Routes messages<br/>Manages memory budget<br/>Aggregates health"]
    end

### Fault Isolation by Zone

| Zone | Failure Type | Impact | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Resources) | OOM, CUDA init | All GPU ops blocked | Full GPU restart |
| Zone 2 (Physics) | CUDA errors, NaN divergence | Physics paused, CPU fallback | Degraded mode |
| Zone 3 (Analytics) | Algorithm errors | Analytics unavailable | Feature disabled |
| Zone 4 (Graph Analytics) | Path query errors | Path queries fail | Feature disabled |

### GPU Self-Init (`ForceComputeActor`)

`ForceComputeActor` initialises CUDA independently on `started()`:

1. Detect available CUDA device (driver API)
2. Allocate node position and velocity CUDA buffers
3. Compile/load PTX kernels (build.rs downgrades `.version` from 9.2 to 9.0 for driver compatibility)
4. Request stream handle from `GPUResourceActor`
5. Signal `PhysicsOrchestratorActor` readiness via `GpuInitComplete`

On CUDA OOM mid-simulation, `ForceComputeActor` emits `ctx.stop()`. The `PhysicsSupervisor` AllForOne strategy restarts all five physics actors, which re-executes the self-init sequence and re-uploads the current constraint set from `OntologyConstraintActor`.

### Kernel Inventory

| Supervisor | Actors | Total Kernels | Frame Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| ResourceSupervisor | 1 | 0 | N/A |
| PhysicsSupervisor | 5 | 66 | 8ms |
| AnalyticsSupervisor | 3 | 21 | 4ms (on-demand) |
| GraphAnalyticsSupervisor | 2 | 7 | 2ms (on-demand) |
| **Total** | **11** | **94** | **14ms** |

---

## 8. Message Patterns

### Request-Response

Used when the caller requires the result before proceeding (e.g., API handler fetching graph data):

```rust
let graph_data: Arc<GraphData> = graph_actor.send(GetGraphData).await?;
```

### Fire-and-Forget

Used for position broadcasts where confirmation is not needed:

```rust
client_coordinator.do_send(BroadcastPositions { binary });
```

### Pub/Sub

`GraphStateActor` maintains a subscriber list and notifies on topology changes:

```rust
impl GraphStateActor {
    fn notify_graph_update(&self, event: GraphUpdateEvent) {
        for subscriber in &self.subscribers {
            subscriber.do_send(event.clone());
        }
    }
}
```

### Coordination (Join)

`PhysicsOrchestratorActor` runs force computation in parallel, then sequences constraints:

```rust
let forces_future = self.force_compute.send(ComputeForces);
let semantic_future = self.semantic_forces.send(ComputeSemanticForces);
let (forces, semantic) = join!(forces_future, semantic_future);
let combined = self.merge_forces(forces?, semantic?);
let constrained = self.constraint_actor.send(ApplyConstraints(combined)).await?;
```
