## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-18

### Added

#### Insight Migration Loop design corpus
- Phase 1 research: 9 artefacts totalling ~19,700 words defining the dual-tier identity, sigmoid scoring, broker workflow, physics forces, acceptance tests
- ADR-048 Dual-tier identity model (KGNode + OntologyClass with BRIDGE_TO edges)
- ADR-049 Insight-migration broker workflow (MigrationCase subtype, DecisionOrchestrator contract)
- PRD: Insight Migration Loop (3 personas, 10 capabilities, 6 migration KPIs)
- DDD context refinement (BC13 MigrationCandidate aggregate, BC11 MigrationCase)
- 00-master.md: synthesised reconciliation resolving 5 cross-artefact contradictions, 8 blocking questions for owner decision

#### Enterprise & Regression Testing
- Enterprise drawer (`EnterpriseDrawerMount`, `EnterpriseDrawer`) — full-viewport slide-out panel with frosted-glass alpha blend, Ctrl+Shift+E / Cmd+Shift+E toggle, floating FAB button
- `drawer-fx` WASM crate (`client/src/wasm/drawer-fx/`) — Rust flow-field ambient effect for enterprise drawer canvas layer; zero-copy `Float32Array` pattern matching `scene-effects`
- Regression tests: `tests/physics_orchestrator_settle_regression.rs`, `tests/settings_physics_propagation_regression.rs`
- `tests/smoke/nginx-coep-headers.sh` — COEP header smoke test
- Enterprise drawer design document: `docs/design/2026-04-17-enterprise-drawer.md`
- QE audit report: `docs/audits/2026-04-17/` (master, frontend graph loading, backend settings routing, failure patterns, regression risk, regression tests — 6 files)
- `enterprise-standalone.tsx` with `#/drawer-demo` hash route for isolated drawer preview

### Fixed
- **PHYSICS: Dual `ClientCoordinatorActor` instances** — `SocketFlowServer` registered clients in one coordinator instance while `PhysicsOrchestratorActor` broadcast to a second internally-created instance, causing 0 binary frames to reach any connected client. Fixed by injecting the shared `ClientCoordinatorActor` address into `GraphServiceSupervisor::with_client()` and skipping internal creation when an external instance is provided.
- **PHYSICS: `ClientFilter` default filter to zero** — `ClientFilter::default()` had `enabled: true` with empty `filtered_node_ids`, causing `broadcast_with_filter` to produce no payload for fresh clients. Fixed by setting `enabled: false` as the default (opt-in filtering, not opt-out).
- **PHYSICS: `FastSettle` permanent latch** — `FastSettle` mode set `fast_settle_complete = true` and `is_physics_paused = true` on reaching the iteration cap even when energy had not converged, preventing subsequent physics parameter changes from resuming simulation. Fixed by falling back to `Continuous` mode on non-convergent exhaustion rather than halting.
- **PHYSICS: Boundary-pinned node rescue** — Added detection for nodes oscillating at viewport boundary (`|coord| >= viewport_bounds - 1` for 60+ consecutive frames) and teleporting them to randomised interior positions, complementing the existing runaway-node rescue (nodes beyond 10× viewport bounds).
- **SLIDER RANGES: Calibrated physics UI sliders** — Attraction (`attractionK`) capped at 10, Dual Graph Separation (`graphSeparationX`) capped at 500, Flatten to Planes (`zDamping`) capped at 0.1. Previous maximums were orders of magnitude too wide.
- **AUTH: Enterprise endpoints returning 403** — `apiFetch` was not injecting auth headers; added auth header injection mirroring `authRequestInterceptor`. Backend `verify_access` now accepts `Bearer dev-session-token` in non-production environments before NIP-98 path.
- **NGINX: COEP headers lost on Vite proxy routes** — Per-location `add_header` now set for all Vite module proxy paths (`/.vite`, `/node_modules`, `/@vite`, etc.) because `add_header` in a `location` block drops server-level headers.
- **DEBUG: Console spam from RemoteLogger** — Gated `originalConsole.log/debug/info` echo behind `localStorage.debug.consoleLogging === 'true'`; `warn` and `error` continue to echo unconditionally.
- **DEBUG: BotsDataProvider polling churn** — `pollingConfig` literal re-created on every render caused `useAgentPolling` to stop and restart every 2 seconds. Fixed with `useMemo` + `useCallback`.
- **WebSocket: `permessage-deflate` misused as subprotocol** — Removed `.protocols(&["permessage-deflate"])` from WebSocket upgrade handler (it is a WebSocket extension, not a subprotocol; placing it in `.protocols()` produced a malformed negotiation header).
- **WebSocket: Frame size limit** — Added `.frame_size(4 * 1024 * 1024)` to WebSocket upgrade handler; default 64 KiB was silently truncating large V5 broadcasts.
- **First-frame render** — `GraphManager` now polls via `window.setInterval` for non-zero positions from `graphWorkerProxy` and calls R3F `invalidate()` when data arrives, fixing the case where the graph was invisible until window resize triggered a re-render.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-08

### Client Architecture Overhaul

#### Graph Worker & Physics

- **Position preservation in setGraphData()**: Worker now preserves interpolated positions for existing nodes when setGraphData is called (from initialGraphLoad, filter updates, reconnects). Only genuinely new nodes receive fresh positions, eliminating the visual "explosion" on graph reload.
- **Interpolation fix**: Server physics lerp factor was 1000x too slow due to `deltaTime / 1000` bug (deltaTime is already in seconds from Three.js clock). Fixed to `1 - Math.pow(0.001, deltaTime)`, converging in ~1 second instead of ~16 minutes.
- **Stable ID mapping**: Non-numeric node IDs now use FNV-1a hash (shared `stringToU32` in `client/src/types/idMapping.ts`) instead of unstable `index + 1`. Collision resolution via linear probe. Ensures consistent numeric IDs across setGraphData calls.
- **ForceComputeActor state preservation**: `iteration_count`, `stability_iterations`, and `reheat_factor` are no longer reset when settings updates arrive. Physics simulation maintains continuity across settings changes.

#### WebSocket Architecture

- **WebSocketEventBus** (`client/src/services/WebSocketEventBus.ts`): New typed pub/sub for cross-service WebSocket events. Event categories: `connection:open/close/error`, `message:graph/voice/bots/pod`, `registry:registered/unregistered/closedAll`.
- **WebSocketRegistry** (`client/src/services/WebSocketRegistry.ts`): Central connection lifecycle tracker. All WebSocket services (Voice, Bots, SolidPod, Graph) register/unregister connections through the registry.
- Eliminated `window.webSocketService` global in favour of direct module imports.

#### Settings Pipeline

- **Simplified useSelectiveSettingsStore**: Reduced from 548 to 152 lines. Removed manual caching, TTL, and debouncing; uses Zustand selectors natively.
- **Backend accepts partial JSON**: Physics and quality-gate PUT handlers now merge partial patches into current settings instead of requiring full payloads.
- **Quality gate defaults raised**: `maxNodeCount` increased from 10,000 to 500,000.

#### Visual System

- **MetadataShapes**: Now respects `nodeSize` setting (applies `sizeMultiplier`). Geometry sizes normalized to ~0.5 bounding sphere radius. Settings lookups hoisted out of per-node per-frame loop for performance.
- **KnowledgeRings**: Only renders on nodes positively identified as `knowledge_graph` type. No longer falls back to the `graphMode` default, preventing incorrect ring display on non-knowledge nodes.

#### Code Quality

- Deleted `lucide-react.d.ts` manual type declarations; converted 32 deep-path imports to barrel imports.
- Replaced `window.webSocketService` global with direct imports across all consuming modules.
- Removed V1 binary protocol dead code. Fixed V4 log spam (warn-once pattern).
- Replaced 14 `console.log` calls with proper logger usage.
- Removed dead functions/imports from GraphManager, websocketStore, and graphDataManager.

### Algorithm Pipeline Completion

- Wire SSSP distances into GPU force kernel `d_sssp_dist` buffer (SSSP-aware spring forces now active)
- Implement delta-stepping for GPU SSSP (configurable bucket width)
- Wire GPU APSP kernel (`approximate_apsp_kernel`) into `ShortestPathActor`
- Add multi-source batched SSSP for efficient landmark computation
- Implement LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) replacing O(n^2) pairwise similarity
- Add CPU SIMD vectorization (AVX2/SSE4.1) for physics fallback
- Implement A* search with Euclidean 3D heuristic
- Implement bidirectional Dijkstra for point-to-point queries
- Add semantic pathfinding with trait-based embedding provider
