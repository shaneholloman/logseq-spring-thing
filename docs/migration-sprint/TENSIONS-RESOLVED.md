# Tensions Resolved — Migration Sprint Quality Audit

Date     : 2026-05-16
Baseline : `radical-rollback` @ `41979d33e`
Authors  : QE fleet synthesis (6 specialists)

## Audit summary

- Original tensions identified by coordinator: 7
- Additional tensions found by cross-cutting review: 18
- Net unique tensions after dedup: **22** (5 blockers, 12 important, 5 nits)
  - 3 dedups: CC-9 ≡ T5 (merged); CC-2 ↔ T1 (conflict, T1 wins, see TC-1); CC-18 ↔ CC-1 (folded into CC-1)
- Specialists deployed: 6 — code-intelligence (T1), security-auditor (T2), performance-validator (T3), api-contract-validator (T4/T6/T7), requirements-validator (T5), code-reviewer (CC-1..CC-18)
- **Decision**: The resolution set is **ready to drive implementation** for every section except where flagged BLOCKER. The five blockers below have specialist-recommended resolutions with verbatim edits; **one (T1↔CC-2) carries a specialist conflict and requires explicit human confirmation of the recommended path before ADR-08 §D6 is rewritten**. The other four blockers can be applied as proposed. IMPORTANT items can be addressed in their respective implementation phases without gating the sprint kick-off.

## Severity legend

- **BLOCKER** — implementation cannot start until resolved
- **IMPORTANT** — resolve before the affected section's implementation phase begins
- **NIT** — clean up during implementation; not gating

## Resolutions in detail

### TC-1 — Class-bit encoding (T1 ⊕ CC-2 merger and conflict resolution)
**Severity**: BLOCKER
**Affected sections**: 02 (binary protocol), 07 (bots), 08 (ontology)
**Source specialist(s)**: T1 (code-intelligence) AND CC-2 (code-reviewer) — **specialists conflict**

#### Specialist conflict, surfaced
- **T1 recommendation (Option A)**: Keep the existing `ONTOLOGY_TYPE_MASK = 0x1C000000`; assign `OntologyClass=0x04, LinkedPage=0x08, Axiom=0x0C, OntologyProperty=0x10` within that mask; **rewrite ADR-08 §D6 to match**. Rationale: code already encodes this layout (`src/utils/binary_protocol.rs:16-27`); zero wire-format break; no GPU change; CUDA `class_id` buffer is unrelated to wire flag bits.
- **CC-2 recommendation**: Adopt ADR-08 §D6 verbatim (`0x20000000 OntologyClass`); make ADR-07 D3 and DDD-07 follow. Rationale: "Section 8 owns the domain model so its ADR text wins."

#### Conflict adjudication (this document's call)
**Adopt T1 Option A. ADR-08 §D6 text is wrong; the code is right.** Mathematically `0x20000000 & 0x1C000000 == 0`, so ADR-08 D6 literal text cannot coexist with PRD-08 §7 and DDD-07. CC-2's reading honours the words; T1's reading honours the working code, the PRD, the DDD, and the wire ABI. Choosing the words requires breaking the wire and the other two specs; choosing the code requires only rewriting eight lines of ADR-08. Lower-cost option chosen.

**Human-confirmation flag**: The project lead should explicitly accept that ADR-08 §D6 was the inaccurate document. Once accepted, TC-1 unblocks Sections 7 and 8 implementation simultaneously.

#### Current state
`src/utils/binary_protocol.rs:16-27` defines six constants (`AGENT 0x80000000`, `KNOWLEDGE 0x40000000`, `ONTOLOGY_TYPE_MASK 0x1C000000`, `ONTOLOGY_CLASS 0x04000000`, `ONTOLOGY_INDIVIDUAL 0x08000000`, `ONTOLOGY_PROPERTY 0x10000000`, `NODE_ID_MASK 0x03FFFFFF`). CUDA `class_id` (`src/utils/visionflow_unified.cu:276-278`, `src/actors/gpu/gpu_resource_actor.rs:241-249`) is a separately uploaded domain-cluster int, unrelated to flag bits. `NEXT_NODE_ID` (`src/models/node.rs:8`) is plain sequential `u32`.

#### Recommended resolution
Adopt T1 Option A allocation: `Agent 0x80000000` (bit 31), `Page 0x40000000` (bit 30), region mask `ONTOLOGY_TYPE_MASK 0x1C000000` (bits 26-28) carrying `OntologyClass 0x04000000`, `LinkedPage 0x08000000` (repurposed from `ONTOLOGY_INDIVIDUAL`), `Axiom 0x0C000000` (new), `OntologyProperty 0x10000000`. Sequence `0x03FFFFFF` (26 bits). Drop `OntologyIndividual` from the domain model (DDD-08 lists no such aggregate).

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/08-ontology-graph-data/ADR-08.md` §D6: replace the existing class-bits paragraph (lines 168-174) with:
  ```markdown
  Class bits encode `NodeClass` in the top 6 bits of the `u32` id:
  `0x80000000 = Agent` (bit 31), `0x40000000 = Page` (bit 30). The
  ontology region uses the mask `ONTOLOGY_TYPE_MASK = 0x1C000000`
  (bits 26-28) with these allocations: `0x04000000 = OntologyClass`,
  `0x08000000 = LinkedPage` (placeholder), `0x0C000000 = Axiom`,
  `0x10000000 = OntologyProperty`. Values `0x14000000`, `0x18000000`,
  `0x1C000000` are reserved for future ontology subtypes. The remaining
  26 bits (`NODE_ID_MASK = 0x03FFFFFF`) are the per-class sequence,
  allocated by the atomic counter in `GraphStateActor`. Per DDD-08 §C2
  the sequence is stable across a `LinkedPage → Page` or
  `LinkedPage → OntologyClass` upgrade — only the class bits change.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/PRD-07.md` line 76 and `ADR-07.md` D3 lines 70-75: drop any redundant restatement of the ontology mask; replace with `See ADR-08 §D6 for the canonical class-bit allocation.`
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/DDD-07.md` line 48: same — replace inline mask with citation to ADR-08 §D6.

#### Verification
- Unit test in `src/utils/binary_protocol.rs` asserting `(ONTOLOGY_CLASS_FLAG | LINKED_PAGE_FLAG | AXIOM_FLAG | ONTOLOGY_PROPERTY_FLAG) & !ONTOLOGY_TYPE_MASK == 0` (every assigned ontology subtype lies inside the mask).
- Round-trip test: `set_axiom_flag(set_sequence(1234)) | NODE_ID_MASK & 0x03FFFFFF == 1234 && is_axiom(...) == true`.
- Grep CI: `rg '0x20000000' docs/migration-sprint/` returns zero matches once edits land.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `src/utils/binary_protocol.rs` (rename `ONTOLOGY_INDIVIDUAL_FLAG` → `LINKED_PAGE_FLAG`; add `AXIOM_FLAG`; update `NodeType` enum + `get_node_type` at lines 183-197); `src/handlers/socket_flow_handler/position_updates.rs:107-172` (LinkedPage/Axiom branches).
- Tests to add: round-trip tests at `src/utils/binary_protocol.rs:1038-1051`; mask-coverage unit test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: **none** — `OntologyClass/Property` unchanged; `LinkedPage` reuses already-occupied `0x08000000`; `Axiom` newly takes previously-unused `0x0C000000`. No CUDA change. No DB change.

### T2 — Auth-bypass gating mechanism
**Severity**: BLOCKER
**Affected sections**: ADR-02 D8, ADR-06 D1+D2, PRD-06 A1+A4
**Source specialist(s)**: T2 (security-auditor)

#### Current state
`src/settings/auth_extractor.rs:39-62, 153-172` carries the bypass code into release binaries, gated by six joint env vars including case-sensitive `APP_ENV`. `src/handlers/socket_flow_handler/http_handler.rs:16-35` repeats the anti-pattern as `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULTS`. Threat model T-A (ops misconfig), T-B (ops-repo supply chain), T-C (FS access) all defeated by compile-time gating with no runtime path. Rust idiom (rustls, tokio, axum-extra) gates dev surfaces with Cargo features; HashiCorp Vault's runtime `-dev` is the documented anti-model.

#### Recommended resolution
Option A (compile-time gating only) + Option D (release-build boot-refusal of suspect dev env vars). ADR-02 D8 defers to ADR-06. PRD-06 A4 corrected. ADR-06 gains a new D11.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/02-binary-protocol/ADR-02.md` §D8: replace existing decision body with:
  ```markdown
  ### D8. Auth model

  WebSocket upgrade requires a `?token=<nostr_jwt>` query param in production.
  In dev mode (`?skipAuth=true` to the HTML shell) the client emits no token;
  the server, if launched with `--allow-skip-auth`, accepts.

  The `--allow-skip-auth` flag is gated *exclusively* by the compile-time
  mechanism specified in ADR-06 D2:
  `#[cfg(any(debug_assertions, feature = "dev-auth"))]`. Release binaries
  built without the `dev-auth` feature physically cannot honour the flag —
  the flag-handling code is absent from the binary. There is no runtime
  env-var path. Section 6 owns this surface; this section defers.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/06-auth-security/PRD-06.md` A4: replace `cfg(debug_assertions) || env(VISIONFLOW_DEV_MODE)` with `cfg(any(debug_assertions, feature = "dev-auth"))`. Delete the `VISIONFLOW_DEV_MODE` reference entirely.
- `docs/migration-sprint/06-auth-security/ADR-06.md` add new decision D11 after D10:
  ```markdown
  ### D11. Startup refusal of dev-mode env vars in release

  The release binary, in `main.rs` after `dotenv().ok()` and before binding
  any socket, refuses to start if any of `SETTINGS_AUTH_BYPASS`,
  `VISIONFLOW_DEV_MODE`, `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULTS`, or `NODE_ENV=development`
  with `DOCKER_ENV` set are present. Logs each offending var to stderr,
  exits with status 2. Wrapped in
  `#[cfg(not(any(debug_assertions, feature = "dev-auth")))]` so dev builds
  skip it. The release binary cannot *honour* these vars (no code reads
  them) but their presence is signal of an ops promotion that brought dev
  settings forward.
  ```

#### Verification
- **V1 symbol absence**: `strings target/release/webxr | grep -E 'SETTINGS_AUTH_BYPASS|VISIONFLOW_DEV_MODE|dev-session-token|dev-user'` → zero hits after `cargo build --release`.
- **V2 argv refusal**: `./target/release/webxr --allow-skip-auth` → exit 1, stderr names the flag.
- **V3 D11 boot refusal**: start release binary with `SETTINGS_AUTH_BYPASS=true VISIONFLOW_DEV_MODE=true NODE_ENV=development DOCKER_ENV=1` → exit 2, each offender named.
- **V4 source-lint cargo test**: greps `src/` for `std::env::var\(.*BYPASS|DEV_MODE|INSECURE` outside `#[cfg(...)]` blocks; fails on match.
- **V5 disassembly sanity**: `objdump -d target/release/webxr | grep -c try_dev_bypass` → 0.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `Cargo.toml` (add `dev-auth = []` feature); `src/main.rs` (~30 lines for D11); `src/settings/auth_extractor.rs:39-62, 153-172` (convert env-gates to `#[cfg]`); `src/handlers/socket_flow_handler/http_handler.rs:16-35` (same gate conversion); `scripts/launch.sh:348-356` (add `dev-auth` to dev `FEATURES=`, omit from prod).
- Tests to add: V1, V3, V4 as CI gates; V2 in startup integration test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### TC-5 — SQLite schema authority (T5 ⊕ CC-5 ⊕ CC-9 merger)
**Severity**: BLOCKER
**Affected sections**: 05 (ADR-05 D5), 06 (ADR-06 D6), 11 (ADR-11 D5, DDD-11)
**Source specialist(s)**: T5 (requirements-validator) + CC-5/CC-9 (code-reviewer)

#### Merged scope
- T5 / CC-9: ADR-05 D5 (`user_settings`, document-per-user) is structurally incompatible with ADR-11 D5 (`settings(key, owner_pubkey)`, per-key-per-user). Trait surface (17 async fn at `src/ports/settings_repository.rs`) is per-key, so ADR-11's design matches the code.
- CC-5 additional: ADR-06 D6's `audit_log` and `audit_log_archive_yyyymm` tables are invisible to ADR-11's enumeration. Persistence ownership is split across three sections with no single authority.

#### Current state
ADR-05 D5 lines 111-137: `user_settings(pubkey PK, settings JSON, schema_ver, updated_at)`. ADR-06 D6 lines 207-222: `audit_log` + indices + monthly archives. ADR-11 D5 lines 130-172: `settings(key, owner_pubkey, value JSON, …) WITHOUT ROWID` + `physics_profiles` + `schema_migrations` + WAL pragmas + pubkey task-local. ADR-11 line 132 misclaims "44 SettingsRepository methods" (actual: 17).

#### Recommended resolution
**ADR-11 §D5 is the sole authority for the SQLite schema and adapter, for every table in `settings.sqlite3`.** ADR-05 §D5 owns only the domain shape (`AppFullSettings`, `PhysicsSettings`, `SettingValue`, validation, UI, defaults, document-level `schema_version`). ADR-06 §D6 owns the audit-log domain but its tables are catalogued in ADR-11 §D5. The 17-method `SettingsRepository` trait is the contract and is frozen.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/05-settings/ADR-05.md` lines 111-137 (D5 body): replace entirely with:
  ```markdown
  ### D5. Persistence: SQLite, schema per ADR-11

  Settings persist in SQLite. **The schema, primary-key layout, per-user
  resolution order, pragmas, and backup mechanics are owned by ADR-11 §D5
  and DDD-11 §"Settings per-user resolution"** — this ADR does not
  duplicate them. Section 5 owns only the contents of what gets stored:

  - The `AppFullSettings` Rust type (generated from `settings.ts` per D1)
    is the domain-level shape. ADR-11's adapter persists it via the
    17-method `SettingsRepository` trait at
    `src/ports/settings_repository.rs`.
  - `AppFullSettings` embeds its own `schema_version: u32` field,
    generated from the `settings.ts` AST. This is distinct from ADR-11's
    `schema_migrations` table: the table tracks which SQL migrations the
    database has applied; the embedded version tracks the shape of an
    individual user's stored document. Section 5 owns the document-shape
    migration ladder (`fn(&mut Value, from: u32) -> u32`); ADR-11's
    adapter invokes it on read when the embedded version is lower than
    current.
  - Anonymous sessions read defaults and receive 401 on save (FR-7).
    Authenticated sessions read and write their own settings; the pubkey
    threads through ADR-11's task-local context, not as a method parameter.
  - The repository trait is frozen by ADR-11 PRD A2. Changes require
    coordinated edits to both ADRs.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/05-settings/ADR-05.md` R3: replace text with:
  ```markdown
  - **R3. Per-document `schema_version` drift.** `AppFullSettings::schema_version`
    (Section 5) and `schema_migrations.id` (Section 11) are independent
    counters answering different questions. Mitigation: distinct names in
    code, plus a unit test asserting they cannot be conflated.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/11-persistence-migration/ADR-11.md` §D5 — insert as first sentence under the heading:
  ```markdown
  This ADR is the sole authority for every table in `settings.sqlite3`,
  including the audit log catalogued from Section 6. ADR-05 (Settings &
  Control Panel) and ADR-06 (Auth & Security) defer to this section for
  all storage and operational concerns; those sections own only their
  domain types (Section 5: `AppFullSettings`, `PhysicsSettings`;
  Section 6: audit event semantics) persisted via the unchanged
  `SettingsRepository` trait surface (17 methods).
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/11-persistence-migration/ADR-11.md` — enumerate `audit_log` and `audit_log_archive_yyyymm` in the D5 table list with a back-reference: `See ADR-06 §D6 for audit event semantics and retention policy.`
- `docs/migration-sprint/11-persistence-migration/ADR-11.md` line 132: change "44 SettingsRepository methods" to "17 SettingsRepository methods".
- After the `WITHOUT ROWID` bullet, append the document-version clarification given verbatim in T5 §"Wording check on ADR-11" item 2.

#### Verification
- Trait-surface SHA test: cargo test computes SHA256 over the sorted method signatures of `SettingsRepository` and asserts it equals a constant; any trait edit forces an explicit version bump and an ADR amendment.
- CI check: `rg 'CREATE TABLE' docs/migration-sprint/` returns only inside `11-persistence-migration/` files. Any `CREATE TABLE` in section 5 or 6 docs is a CI failure.
- BDD scenarios (3) defined in T5 §"BDD scenarios" — domain-only change, storage-only change, cross-cutting change.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `src/adapters/sqlite_settings_repository.rs` (single adapter implementing all 17 methods); `src/config/generated_settings.rs` (embedded `schema_version`); audit-log adapter co-located.
- Tests to add: trait-surface SHA test; three BDD scenarios from T5.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: SQLite schema canonicalised; `audit_log` + archives added to the enumeration; no behaviour change in the audit-log adapter.

### T4 — WebSocket URL space ownership
**Severity**: BLOCKER
**Affected sections**: 02, 06, 07, 10, 12
**Source specialist(s)**: T4 (api-contract-validator). CC-6 subsumed.

#### Current state
Baseline registers 7 WS endpoints (`src/main.rs:694-698`, `bots_visualization_handler.rs:507`, `multi_mcp_websocket_handler.rs:925`, `api_handler/analytics/mod.rs:193`, `api_handler/ontology/mod.rs:1366`). Sprint adds 3 (`/ws/xr-presence`, `/ws/agent-telemetry`, `/ws/enterprise-events`). No single section enumerates the lot. ADR-06 D5 cites `wss://<host>/api/ws/...` (wrong; canonical is `/wss`). ADR-12 D9 names `wss://<host>/ws` (wrong; baseline is `/wss`).

#### Recommended resolution
Add new ADR-06 §D11 as the sole authority for the WebSocket URL surface, containing the 11-row canonical table from T4. Cross-link from ADR-02/07/10/12.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/06-auth-security/ADR-06.md` — add new decision D11 (after the auth D11 added by T2; renumber if needed) containing the 11-row enumeration table reproduced from the T4-T6-T7 resolution document §T4 "Canonical WebSocket endpoint enumeration", followed by:
  ```markdown
  Cross-section ownership:
  - §D11 owns the URL space and the auth posture per endpoint.
  - Each owning section defines the wire format for its endpoint.
  - Default backpressure is drop-never-queue (ADR-02 D3); deviations
    documented in the owning ADR.
  ```
  (CC-6: the `/ws/xr-presence` row is in this table with `RequireAuth — Nostr-signed JWT at upgrade only`.)
- `docs/migration-sprint/06-auth-security/ADR-06.md` D5 — replace the CSP rationale parenthetical citing `wss://<host>/api/ws/...` with:
  ```markdown
  WebSocket endpoints are enumerated in §D11. All endpoints are same-origin
  (`wss://<host>/wss`, `wss://<host>/ws/...`, `wss://<host>/api/<section>/ws`)
  and fall under `'self'`. External `wss:` is not used.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/12-xr-client/ADR-12.md` D9 — change every occurrence of `/ws` (graph-data path) to `/wss`.

#### Verification
- CI script parses `App::new()` route registrations in `src/main.rs` and asserts every `.route("/ws...")` and `.route("/wss")` appears as a row in ADR-06 §D11. PR fails on drift.
- Grep CI: `rg 'wss?://[^/]+/api/ws' docs/migration-sprint/` returns zero matches (no stale endpoint references).

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: only documentation in this sprint. CI route-drift check lives at `scripts/ci/check-ws-route-enumeration.sh`.
- Tests to add: route-enumeration drift check in CI.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: documentary only.

### T7 — Agent-click action envelope specification
**Severity**: BLOCKER
**Affected sections**: 07 (ADR-07 D8), 10 (ADR-10 D3)
**Source specialist(s)**: T7 (api-contract-validator)

#### Current state
ADR-07 D8 names an internal intent `RequestAgentControlSurface { agent_id, swarm_id, cursor_world_position }` and defers to Section 10. ADR-10 D3 gives a partial JSON shape and BroadcastChannel hint but no `type` discriminator, no `schema_version`, no origin-verification rules, no shared TS type. Both sides will guess.

#### Recommended resolution
Add the full `AgentActionEnvelope` schema to `crates/visionclaw-contracts/src/agent_action.rs` (Rust source of truth) with `ts-rs`-generated `.d.ts` at `client/src/types/contracts/agent-action.d.ts`. ADR-10 D3 and ADR-07 D8 rewritten to reference the contracts crate.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/ADR-10.md` D3 — replace the JSON snippet and transport selection prose with:
  ```markdown
  The envelope shape, BroadcastChannel constant, deep-link template, and
  `AgentActionTargetOrigin` allowlist type are defined in
  `crates/visionclaw-contracts/src/agent_action.rs` and generated as
  `client/src/types/contracts/agent-action.d.ts`. The full schema is
  reproduced in `_resolutions/T4-T6-T7-api-contracts.md` §T7. Receivers
  MUST verify `type === "visionflow:agent-action"` and
  `schema_version === 1`; postMessage receivers additionally enforce
  `event.origin` against the allowlist. Unknown `kind` values are no-ops
  (forward-compatible). This envelope supersedes ADR-07 D8's
  `RequestAgentControlSurface` intent.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/ADR-07.md` D8 — replace the decision body with:
  ```markdown
  Clicking an agent capsule constructs an `AgentActionEnvelope` (ADR-10 D3
  plus `crates/visionclaw-contracts/src/agent_action.rs`) and dispatches it
  via the session's chosen transport. VisionFlow does not render a control
  panel in-process and does not embed an iframe of one; the renderer's
  responsibility ends at envelope dispatch.
  ```

The envelope schema (full TypeScript declaration including `AgentActionEnvelope`, `AGENT_ACTION_CHANNEL`, `AGENT_ACTION_DEEP_LINK_TEMPLATE`, `AgentActionTargetOrigin` and the normative origin-check table) is reproduced verbatim in `_resolutions/T4-T6-T7-api-contracts.md` §T7 and is the source of truth for this resolution.

#### Verification
- `crates/visionclaw-contracts` compiles; `ts-rs` test generates `agent-action.d.ts` byte-identical to the committed file.
- Contract test at `tests/contracts/external-integrations/agent_action.rs`: builds every envelope variant, asserts receiver rejects `type !== "visionflow:agent-action"` and `schema_version !== 1` with structured error; round-trips via BroadcastChannel and postMessage; postMessage path fails closed on unlisted origin.
- Grep: `rg 'RequestAgentControlSurface' src/` returns zero hits after the rewrite.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to create: `crates/visionclaw-contracts/src/agent_action.rs`, generated `client/src/types/contracts/agent-action.d.ts`, `tests/contracts/external-integrations/agent_action.rs`.
- Files to modify: agent-click handler in `client/src/components/...` (one site) to construct the envelope and dispatch by transport.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: the envelope is a new cross-boundary contract; once shipped it is versioned by `schema_version` per ADR-10 D8.

### T3 — Heartbeat: iteration vs wall-clock
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 01 (DDD-01, ADR-01 D9), 02 (ADR-02 D2)
**Source specialist(s)**: T3 (performance-validator)

#### Current state
ADR-01 D9 expresses `LayoutHeartbeat` in iteration-counts (300). ADR-02 D2 expresses it in wall-clock (5 s). At 60 Hz they coincide; off 60 Hz they diverge. Physics tick rate is variable: `FastSettle` (default) runs as fast as the GPU produces completions (`src/actors/physics_orchestrator_actor.rs:215-230`); large graphs at 5 Hz → heartbeat every 60 s; paused → never. Heartbeat is semantically a broadcast cadence, not a physics event.

#### Recommended resolution
Wall-clock owned by broadcast actor; physics emits no heartbeat. Physics emits four events: `LayoutStarted`, `LayoutSettled`, `LayoutDestabilised`, `PhysicsClamped`. Broadcast actor holds a `tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_secs(broadcast_heartbeat_secs))` alive only in SETTLED state.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/01-physics/ADR-01.md` §D9 — replace decision body with:
  ```markdown
  ### D9. Broadcast cadence governed by settlement, not FPS

  ADR-02 owns this in detail. From the physics-side perspective: the actor
  emits **state-transition events only** — `LayoutStarted`,
  `LayoutSettled { iteration, rms_velocity }`, and
  `LayoutDestabilised { iteration, rms_velocity }`. Settlement is detected
  via RMS-velocity hysteresis across the last N ticks. The physics actor
  emits **no time-based heartbeat**: wall-clock heartbeat cadence is a
  broadcast concern (see ADR-02 D2) and is wholly owned by the broadcast
  actor.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/01-physics/DDD-01.md` §Domain events — remove the `LayoutHeartbeat` bullet entirely. Physics events become four.
- `docs/migration-sprint/02-binary-protocol/ADR-02.md` §D2 — replace the `On LayoutSettled` paragraph with:
  ```markdown
  On `LayoutSettled`: enter SETTLED state. The broadcast actor starts a
  `tokio::time::interval(broadcast_heartbeat_secs)` (default 5 s); each
  tick reads `GraphStateActor::current_snapshot()` and emits a full V3
  frame to all connected clients. The interval is cancelled on
  `LayoutDestabilised` and on shutdown.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/02-binary-protocol/PRD-02.md` §4 — add acceptance criterion A8:
  ```markdown
  A8. **Heartbeat is wall-clock, not iteration-driven.** In the SETTLED
  state, full-position frames emit every `broadcast_heartbeat_secs` of
  wall-clock time (default 5 s), independent of physics tick rate.
  Verified by a test that pauses physics entirely and observes a
  heartbeat within 5.5 s.
  ```

#### Verification
- BDD-1 (paused physics emits heartbeat within 5.5 s), BDD-2 (5-s cadence at 200 Hz physics), BDD-3 (interval cancelled within 100 ms of destabilisation) — all three defined in T3 §"Test scenarios".

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `src/actors/gpu/force_compute_actor.rs:1448-1480, 1528-1560` (remove iter≥300 branches); `src/actors/physics_orchestrator_actor.rs:538-590, 1100-1178` (remove 60 FPS broadcast throttles); `src/actors/client_coordinator_actor.rs:455-525, 748-768` (replace 3 `broadcast_interval` Durations with single `Option<SpawnHandle>`); `src/gpu/broadcast_optimizer.rs` deleted (ADR-02 D5).
- Tests to add: BDD-1/2/3 as integration tests.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none; same V3 frames, different scheduler.

### T6 — Bots deletion-candidate routes
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 07 (ADR-07 D12), 10 (ADR-10 D7)
**Source specialist(s)**: T6 (api-contract-validator)

#### Current state
ADR-07 D12 names 5 deletion candidates with naming drift vs baseline: `POST /api/bots/graph` doesn't exist (handler exposed as `/data` and `/update`); `POST /api/bots/spawn-agent` exists only as a client fallback (`BotsControlPanel.tsx:101`); `POST /api/bots/create-task` and `/stop-task` are not registered routes (internal actor messages only). Consumer audit shows no external on-disk callers but the `agentbox/` directory is gitignored and not provably empty.

#### Recommended resolution
Two-phase deletion. Phase 7a: handlers return `410 Gone` + `Link: <successor>; rel="successor-version"`; route remains registered so callers get structured failure. Phase 7b (~30 days later): route + handler deleted; doc refs removed.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/ADR-07.md` §D12 — replace decision body with the table and `410 Gone` JSON body reproduced from the T4-T6-T7 resolution document §T6 "Proposed wording — revised ADR-07 D12". Key table:
  ```markdown
  | Baseline route | Successor (agentbox) | Phase 7a | Phase 7b |
  |----------------|----------------------|----------|----------|
  | POST /api/bots/initialize-swarm | POST {agentbox}/swarms/initialize | 410+Link | Deleted |
  | POST /api/bots/spawn-agent-hybrid | POST {agentbox}/agents/spawn | 410+Link | Deleted |
  | POST /api/bots/spawn-agent (legacy) | (same) | 410+Link | Deleted |
  | POST /api/bots/data, POST /api/bots/update | (no successor — was inverted client→server graph write; see D3) | 410+Link to D3 | Deleted |
  | DELETE /api/bots/remove-task/{id} | DELETE {agentbox}/tasks/{id} | 410+Link | Deleted |
  ```
  Routes retained (read-only telemetry until `/ws/agent-telemetry` parity): `GET /api/agents/identity/{id}`, `GET /api/bots/{status,agents,data}`. Re-homed at `src/handlers/telemetry_handler.rs`.
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/ADR-10.md` §D7 — append:
  ```markdown
  Additionally, scan for re-introduction of deprecated bots control-plane
  route names (`/initialize-swarm`, `/spawn-agent`, `/spawn-agent-hybrid`,
  `/remove-task`, `/bots/data` POST, `/bots/update` POST) under
  `src/handlers/`. The Phase 7b removal date in ADR-07 D12 is the date
  these become hard CI failures.
  ```

#### Verification
- HTTP-level test: `POST /api/bots/initialize-swarm` returns 410, `Link` header matches successor, body has `successor`, `deprecated_since`, `scheduled_removal`.
- Metric `bots_deprecated_route_calls_total{route}` exposed at `/metrics`; baseline value zero after internal call sites removed.
- CI grep: re-introduction of the deprecated names triggers failure after Phase 7b date.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `src/handlers/api_handler/bots/mod.rs` (replace handler bodies with `410 Gone` builder); remove client call sites at `client/src/components/BotsControlPanel.tsx:71,101`, `MultiAgentInitializationPrompt.tsx:162-163`, `AgentControlPanel.tsx:110`.
- Tests to add: HTTP-level deprecation tests; CI route-name greps; metric registration test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: callers see structured 410 with successor link; clean migration window.

### CC-1 — Telemetry wire ↔ internal event divergence (folds CC-18)
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 07 (DDD-07), 10 (ADR-10 D1)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-1, CC-18 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
ADR-10 D1 wire envelope catalogue: `snapshot`, `delta`, `agent_added`, `agent_removed`, `heartbeat` (5 types). DDD-07 internal events: `AgentJoined`, `AgentPositionUpdated`, `AgentStatusChanged`, `AgentCommunicated`, `AgentDeparted`, `SwarmSnapshot`, `Heartbeat` (7 events). Three failures: (a) wire `agent_added` → internal `AgentJoined` rename silent; (b) wire `delta` → multiple internal events with no dispatch rule; (c) internal `AgentCommunicated` has no wire counterpart but ADR-07 D5 line 95 depends on a `CommunicationEvent`. CC-18 is the same pattern for `SwarmSnapshot` ↔ `snapshot`.

#### Recommended resolution
Section 10 owns the transport. Add a `"type": "communication"` envelope to ADR-10 D1 with payload `{ from_agent_id, to_agent_id, weight }`. DDD-07's anti-corruption layer must contain an explicit wire→internal mapping table — one row per wire type — covering the rename of `agent_added`/`SwarmSnapshot`/etc.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/ADR-10.md` §D1 — add new wire envelope variant after `heartbeat`:
  ```markdown
  - `"type": "communication"` — emitted when one agent communicates with
    another. Payload: `{ from_agent_id: string, to_agent_id: string,
    weight: number }`. Maps to DDD-07's `AgentCommunicated` internal event.
  ```
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/DDD-07.md` §"Anti-corruption layer to Section 10" (lines 235-253) — add at the end of the section:
  ```markdown
  | Wire `type` (ADR-10 D1) | Internal event (this DDD) | Notes |
  |--------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
  | `snapshot` | `SwarmSnapshot` | Full-state, used on connect / reconnect. |
  | `delta` | `AgentPositionUpdated` and/or `AgentStatusChanged` | Dispatch per changed field in payload. |
  | `agent_added` | `AgentJoined` | Pure rename. |
  | `agent_removed` | `AgentDeparted` | Pure rename. |
  | `heartbeat` | `Heartbeat` | Liveness only; no graph mutation. |
  | `communication` | `AgentCommunicated` | New in this sprint. |
  ```

#### Verification
- Contract test instantiates each wire variant, asserts the ACL produces exactly the expected internal event(s); fails on unmapped types.
- Grep CI: `rg 'CommunicationEvent' src/ docs/` returns zero hits after ADR-07 D5 line 95 is corrected to `AgentCommunicated`.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: ADR-10 D1, DDD-07 ACL, ADR-07 D5 line 95 (rename `CommunicationEvent` → `AgentCommunicated`).
- Tests to add: wire→internal mapping contract test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: new wire variant `communication` (additive, forward-compatible per ADR-10 D8).

### CC-3 — `LayoutStarted` not consumed by broadcast layer
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 01 (DDD-01), 02 (ADR-02 D2)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-3 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
DDD-01 emits `LayoutStarted`; ADR-02 D2 references `LayoutDestabilised`/`LayoutSettled`/`LayoutHeartbeat`/`PhysicsClamped` only. On panic recovery (ADR-01 D4) broadcast behaviour is undefined.

#### Recommended resolution
ADR-02 D2 explicitly handles `LayoutStarted` by resetting `frame_id` and emitting a snapshot.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/02-binary-protocol/ADR-02.md` §D2 — append (after the SETTLED paragraph edited by T3):
  ```markdown
  On `LayoutStarted` the broadcast actor resets `frame_id = 0` for the
  current epoch, immediately emits a position-frame snapshot to all
  connected clients, and transitions to ACTIVE. The next emitted frame
  carries `frame_id = 1`. Coordinated with ADR-02 D7 drop-detection: a
  client whose previous epoch's `frame_id` was non-zero MUST treat the
  reset as a hard reload, not a gap.
  ```

#### Verification
- Integration test: trigger physics restart, assert broadcast actor emits snapshot within one tick and `frame_id` resets.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: broadcast actor state machine.
- Tests to add: restart-snapshot integration test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none — same V3 frames; reset signalled by `frame_id` going to 0 then 1.

---

### CC-4 — Inference named-graph IRI disagreement
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 08 (ADR-08 D2, D9), 11 (ADR-11 D2, PRD-11 A6)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-4 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
ADR-08 D9 uses `<urn:visionflow:inference>`. ADR-11 D2 and PRD-11 A6 use `<urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:inferred>`. SPARQL queries against the wrong IRI return empty.

#### Recommended resolution
Section 11 owns the persistence layout. Section 8 adopts `<urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:inferred>` verbatim.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/08-ontology-graph-data/ADR-08.md` — replace every occurrence of `<urn:visionflow:inference>` with `<urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:inferred>`. Spell out the two named graphs explicitly at D2 line 88:
  ```markdown
  The Oxigraph dataset uses two named graphs:
  `<urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:assert>` for asserted triples and
  `<urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:inferred>` for whelk-rs-derived
  inferences (see ADR-11 §D2).
  ```

#### Verification
- Grep CI: `rg 'urn:visionflow:inference\b' docs/ src/` returns zero matches after edit.
- SPARQL smoke test: `SELECT * WHERE { GRAPH <urn:visionflow:graph:ontology:inferred> { ?s ?p ?o } } LIMIT 1` returns a result after first inference run.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: documentation only; implementation uses Section 11's IRI from inception.
- Tests to add: SPARQL named-graph round-trip test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-6 — `/ws/xr-presence` missing from ADR-06 D4 (subsumed by T4)
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 06, 12
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-6 (code-reviewer)

#### Resolution
Folded into T4's ADR-06 §D11 enumeration. The `/ws/xr-presence` row is present in the canonical table with posture `RequireAuth — Nostr-signed JWT at upgrade only (no per-frame signing at 30 Hz)`. CC-6 is closed by applying T4's edits; ADR-06 D4 (HTTP table) is unchanged.

#### Verification
- The §D11 table check from T4 covers this.

---

### CC-7 — README phasing contradicts ADR-06 ordering
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: README §Phasing, ADR-06 §Phasing
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-7 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
README lines 113-128 puts all of Section 6 in Phase 7. ADR-06 §Phasing lines 368-388 says "D1+D2 (compile-time gates) must land before Phase 3 (binary protocol) because ADR-02 D8 depends on `--allow-skip-auth` existing." Strict README order blocks ADR-02 D8.

#### Recommended resolution
Split Section 6 across two phases. D1+D2 land in a new Phase 2.5 (between Persistence and Binary Protocol). D3-D11 remain in Phase 7.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/README.md` lines 113-128 — restructure the phasing list to insert a new entry between current Phase 2 and Phase 3:
  ```markdown
  **Phase 2.5: Auth compile-gates** — Section 6 ADR-06 D1 (`dev-auth` Cargo
  feature) and D2 (compile-time gating of `--allow-skip-auth` and any
  bypass surface) land. Section 6's remaining decisions D3-D11 ship in
  Phase 7. This split is mandated by ADR-06 §Phasing: ADR-02 D8 depends on
  the `--allow-skip-auth` flag existing in the codebase as of Phase 3.
  ```
  And remove Section 6 from the Phase 7 cluster's full-section enumeration; add a note "Section 6 (D3-D11 only — D1+D2 landed in Phase 2.5)".

#### Verification
- ADR cross-reference check: ADR-06 §Phasing's "must land before Phase 3" claim now matches README chronology.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `docs/migration-sprint/README.md` only.
- Tests to add: none (documentary).
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-8 — WASM build path missing from Dockerfile
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 04 (PRD-04 F7, ADR-04 D8), 09 (ADR-09 D3)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-8 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
PRD-04 F7 and ADR-04 D8 expect `client/crates/scene-effects/` compiled to `client/src/wasm/scene-effects/`. ADR-09 D3 enumerates stages `base`/`rust-deps`/`rust-builder`/`node-deps`/`node-builder`/`development`/`production` — no WASM stage. Clean production builds will ship without the WASM artefacts.

#### Recommended resolution
ADR-09 D3 adds a `wasm-builder` stage (or extends `node-builder`) that runs `wasm-pack build` against `client/crates/scene-effects/` and outputs to `client/src/wasm/scene-effects/`.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/09-ecosystem-services/ADR-09.md` §D3 — add a new stage entry to the Dockerfile-stage enumeration:
  ```markdown
  - **`wasm-builder`** (after `rust-deps`, before `node-builder`): runs
    `wasm-pack build --target web --release client/crates/scene-effects/`
    and outputs JS/wasm glue to `client/src/wasm/scene-effects/`. The
    `node-builder` stage `COPY --from=wasm-builder` consumes this path
    before `vite build` runs. The `node-builder`'s output therefore
    contains the compiled WASM as part of the static bundle. PRD-04 F7's
    versioning contract holds via the same `client/dist` artefact.
  ```

#### Verification
- Integration test: `docker build --target production .` produces an image whose `/usr/share/nginx/html/wasm/scene-effects/` contains both `.js` and `.wasm` files; file sizes non-zero.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: `Dockerfile` (new `wasm-builder` stage); `ADR-09 D3`.
- Tests to add: production-image WASM-artefact presence check.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-10 — "snapshot" overloaded
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 02, 07, 10, 11
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-10 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
"Snapshot" carries three meanings: position-frame snapshot (Section 2), telemetry snapshot (Sections 7/10), persistence snapshot (Section 11 — either 60-s `:hasX/Y/Z` write or operator backup). Cross-references leak ambiguity.

#### Recommended resolution
Add a §"Glossary of overloaded terms" to `README.md`. Each section qualifies "snapshot" at first use with an adjective: position-frame / telemetry / persistence / position-triple.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/README.md` — append new section:
  ```markdown
  ## Glossary of overloaded terms

  | Term | Disambiguated forms |
  |------|---------------------|
  | snapshot | **position-frame snapshot** (ADR-02 D4 — V3 binary frame from `GraphStateActor::current_snapshot()`); **telemetry snapshot** (ADR-10 D1, DDD-07 — `SwarmSnapshot` JSON on agent reconnect); **persistence snapshot** (ADR-11 D4/D10 — operator backup); **position-triple snapshot** (DDD-11 — per-60 s `:hasX/Y/Z` Oxigraph write). |

  Authoring rule: at first use in any document, write the qualified form.
  Subsequent in-document uses may shorten to "snapshot" if unambiguous.
  ```

#### Verification
- Doc-lint check: each PRD/ADR/DDD's first occurrence of `snapshot` is preceded by `position-frame|telemetry|persistence|position-triple` within 5 words.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: README + first-use qualification across sections.
- Tests to add: doc-lint check.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-11 — Section 12 cross-references conflicting bit schemes
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 02, 04, 08, 12
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-11 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
PRD-12 F3 cites Section 7's `0x1C000000` scheme; ADR-12 D4 cites "Section 8 / Section 2" with the 6-bit scheme; PRD-04 F1 chains vaguely; ADR-02 D1 says "u32 node_id (including class flag bits)" without enumeration. Multiple co-existing citations to mutually-inconsistent schemes.

#### Recommended resolution
After TC-1 collapses the two schemes onto T1 Option A, point every cross-reference at ADR-08 §D6.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/12-xr-client/PRD-12.md` F3 lines 110-113: replace mask phrasing with `See ADR-08 §D6 for the canonical class-bit allocation.`
- `docs/migration-sprint/12-xr-client/ADR-12.md` D4 line 121: replace `"the same scheme the web client uses (per Section 8 / Section 2)"` with `"See ADR-08 §D6."`
- `docs/migration-sprint/04-client-3d-rendering/PRD-04.md` F1 line 68: replace the chained citation with `See ADR-08 §D6.`
- `docs/migration-sprint/02-binary-protocol/ADR-02.md` D1 line 89: append `(a NodeId per ADR-08 §D6).`

#### Verification
- Grep CI: `rg '0x1C000000|0x20000000' docs/migration-sprint/` returns matches **only** in `08-ontology-graph-data/ADR-08.md` and `_resolutions/`.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: four sections, one line each.
- Tests to add: scheme-citation grep gate.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-14 — Worker surface forbids telemetry path PRD-07 claims
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 03 (ADR-03 D7, D9), 07 (PRD-07 §8)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-14 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
ADR-03 D7 fixes the worker proxy surface to exactly four methods (`attachPositionSAB`, `writeFrame`, `computeEdgeLengths`, `getStats`); D9 says non-position WS frames flow through text-frame handlers and "none of these touch the worker". PRD-07 §8 claims the agent telemetry stream uses the same Comlink-bridged worker pipeline. Direct contradiction.

#### Recommended resolution
ADR-03 is the source of truth on the worker surface. Rewrite PRD-07 §8: telemetry goes through the WebSocket but is decoded on the main thread. Single-flight discipline applies via the Section-7 coalescer (DDD-07 D11), not the worker frame guard.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/07-bots-telemetry/PRD-07.md` §8 lines 184-186 — replace the contested paragraph with:
  ```markdown
  Section 3 (Client State). The agent telemetry stream is delivered via
  WebSocket and decoded on the main thread (text-frame path; see ADR-03
  §D9). The worker proxy surface is closed to four methods per ADR-03 §D7
  and does not handle telemetry. Single-flight discipline for telemetry
  updates is enforced by the Section-7 coalescer (DDD-07 D11), not by the
  worker's frame guard.
  ```

#### Verification
- Cross-reference check: PRD-07 §8 cites ADR-03 §D7 and §D9 correctly; no `worker` references in PRD-07 §8 imply the four-method surface is extended.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: PRD-07 §8 only.
- Tests to add: none (alignment edit).
- ABI/wire/schema impact: none.

### CC-15 — GitHub adapter referenced but absent from Section 10
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 08 (ADR-08 D10, DDD-08), 10 (PRD-10 §1+§6, ADR-10)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-15 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
ADR-08 D10 and DDD-08 §ACL declare a GitHub adapter producing `ParsedMarkdown` value objects and attribute the contract to Section 10. PRD-10 §1 enumerates three external systems (agentbox, forum, whelk-rs); §6 contracts table has six rows. **GitHub is absent.** Section 8 implements against a phantom contract.

#### Recommended resolution
PRD-10 §1 add a fourth external system (GitHub / Logseq corpus). ADR-10 add a new D11 covering: transport (octocrab REST), `ParsedMarkdown` value-object shape (delegating to DDD-08), SHA1 incremental gating, `FORCE_FULL_SYNC=1` semantics, parse-error envelope.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/PRD-10.md` §1 — add to the external-systems list:
  ```markdown
  4. **GitHub (Logseq corpus)** — `jjohare/logseq` markdown source-of-truth
     for the knowledge graph. Read-only HTTPS via `octocrab`. Section 8 owns
     the parse; this section owns the transport. See ADR-10 §D11.
  ```
  And add a sixth row to the §6 contracts-at-a-glance table for GitHub.
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/ADR-10.md` — add new decision after D10:
  ```markdown
  ### D11. GitHub adapter (Logseq corpus)

  Transport: `octocrab` REST client. Auth: `GITHUB_TOKEN` from environment.
  Output value object: `ParsedMarkdown` as defined by DDD-08 §"Anti-corruption
  layer to Section 10" — Section 10 is the transport, Section 8 owns the
  parse and the value-object shape.

  Sync gating: `GitHubSyncService::sync_graphs()` SHA1-compares each file's
  blob against the cached hash and skips unchanged files. The
  `FORCE_FULL_SYNC=1` environment variable bypasses gating and forces full
  reparse — used for content-format migrations. Set back to `0` after use.

  Parse-error envelope: errors carry `{ path: string, sha: string,
  error_kind: "yaml" | "wikilink" | "ontology-block" | "io", message: string }`.
  Errors are logged but do not fail the sync; the failed file is retained
  at its previous good version in Neo4j and surfaced as an operator metric
  `github_sync_parse_errors_total{error_kind}`.
  ```

#### Verification
- Cross-reference check: every `Section 10` mention in DDD-08 / ADR-08 resolves to a numbered decision (D11 covers the gap).
- Contract test: `tests/contracts/external-integrations/github_adapter.rs` exercises sync, force-full-sync, parse-error envelope.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: PRD-10 §1 + §6, ADR-10 new D11.
- Tests to add: GitHub adapter contract test.
- ABI/wire/schema impact: documentary; the implementation already exists at `src/services/github_sync_service.rs`.

### CC-17 — Ecosystem services have no documented consumers
**Severity**: IMPORTANT
**Affected sections**: 06, 09 (ADR-09 D5), 10
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-17 (code-reviewer)

#### Current state
ADR-09 D5 declares Kokoro TTS (8880), Whisper (8000), Xinference (9997). No section documents which VisionFlow code consumes them. ADR-06 D4 lists `speech_socket_handler`, `inference_handler`, `ragflow_handler` without service mapping.

#### Recommended resolution
ADR-09 add §"Consumers" listing each ecosystem service ↔ VisionFlow handler.

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/09-ecosystem-services/ADR-09.md` — append new section after D5:
  ```markdown
  ### D5a. Consumers

  | Ecosystem service | VisionFlow consumer | WS endpoint | ADR-06 D4 handler |
  |-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
  | Kokoro TTS (8880) | TTS dispatch in speech actor | `/ws/speech` (egress) | `speech_socket_handler` |
  | Whisper STT (8000) | STT dispatch in speech actor | `/ws/speech` (ingress) | `speech_socket_handler` |
  | Xinference (9997) | RAG embeddings + completion | n/a (HTTP) | `inference_handler`, `ragflow_handler` |

  Out-of-scope for this sprint: any expansion of this consumer list.
  Adding a new ecosystem service requires a row here in the same PR.
  ```

#### Verification
- Cross-reference check: every handler named in ADR-06 D4 that touches an ecosystem service appears in the D5a table.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: ADR-09 §D5a (new sub-section).
- Tests to add: none (documentary).

### CC-12 — Audit archive table growth not in backup procedure
**Severity**: NIT
**Affected sections**: 06 (ADR-06 D6), 11 (ADR-11 D10)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-12 (code-reviewer)

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/11-persistence-migration/ADR-11.md` §Risks — append:
  ```markdown
  - **Audit archive table growth.** ADR-06 §D6 creates monthly archive
    tables `audit_log_archive_yyyymm` that accumulate indefinitely.
    Mitigation: operator runbook at `docs/operations/audit-log-retention.md`
    covers `DROP TABLE audit_log_archive_yyyymm` for retired months
    (default retention 24 months).
  ```

#### Verification
- Runbook file exists at the cited path.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: ADR-11 §Risks; new operator runbook.

### CC-13 — BroadcastChannel naming convention undeclared
**Severity**: NIT
**Affected sections**: 10 (ADR-10 D3, D4)
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-13 (code-reviewer)

#### Proposed edits
- `docs/migration-sprint/10-external-integrations/ADR-10.md` — append a small subsection after D4:
  ```markdown
  ### BroadcastChannel naming convention

  Prefix: `visionflow:`. Suffix: kebab-case noun describing the channel's
  payload. Current channels: `visionflow:agent-actions` (D3),
  `visionflow:auth` (D4). New channels register here in the same PR that
  introduces them.
  ```

#### Verification
- Grep CI: `rg "BroadcastChannel\(['\"]" client/src/` — every literal matches `visionflow:[a-z-]+`.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: ADR-10 (subsection); future channels add a row.

---

### CC-16 — PRD/ADR heading conventions inconsistent
**Severity**: NIT
**Affected sections**: all
**Source specialist(s)**: CC-16 (code-reviewer)

#### Proposed edits
None for existing docs. Add `docs/migration-sprint/_templates/PRD-template.md` and `ADR-template.md` for future authoring, using PRD-12's `F1..Fn` + `A1..An` shape as canonical. Do not retrofit.

#### Verification
- Template files exist; future PRDs reference them.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to create: two templates.

### CC-Gaps — Coverage gaps (five unowned surfaces)
**Severity**: NIT (collectively); individual items may surface during implementation
**Affected sections**: 03, 06, 09, 11, 12
**Source specialist(s)**: CC §"Coverage gaps" (code-reviewer)

#### Items
1. **Cloudflared tunnel ownership.** ADR-09 D12 punts to Section 6; ADR-06 has no tunnel section. **Resolution**: ADR-06 add a one-paragraph subsection D12 owning the tunnel config + secret rotation, or explicitly hand back to Section 9. Recommended owner: ADR-06 (auth surface).
2. **Auth endpoint path inconsistency.** PRD-12 F2 / ADR-12 D8 use `/auth/challenge` and `/auth/verify`; ADR-06 D4 has `/challenge` and `/session`. **Resolution**: reconcile to `/api/auth/*` in ADR-06 D4; ADR-12 follows.
3. **Migration tool fate post-cutover.** DDD-11 line 509 says removed from workspace; ADR-11 step 8 deletes only adapter files. **Resolution**: ADR-11 §Implementation order add explicit "delete `tools/migrate-neo4j-to-oxigraph/` 14 days after cutover, after one successful re-run verifies backup path."
4. **`computeEdgeLengths` consumer.** ADR-03 D7 surfaces it; no section calls it. **Resolution**: verify and prune. If dead, drop from D7's four-method surface (now three).
5. **NIP-98 canonical URL spec location.** ADR-06 D10 says client and server share `canonicalise_url` but the spec is in prose only. **Resolution**: ADR-06 D10 promote the trailing-slash / param-order / fragment-handling rules to a numbered list; cite by anchor.

#### Verification
Each item resolved during the affected section's implementation phase; no blocker.

#### Implementation impact
- Files to modify: section-by-section as the items come up.

## Cross-cutting follow-ups

These follow-ups are not new tensions; they consolidate engineering work that multiple specialists called out:

1. **`crates/visionclaw-contracts`** — shared crate hosting `AgentActionEnvelope`, `AgentTelemetryEnvelope`, `EnterpriseEventEnvelope`, binary-protocol header constants. `ts-rs` emits `.d.ts`. ADR-10 §D8 versioning gates the crate's semver. Required for T7 closure; benefits CC-1, CC-15.
2. **Contract test harness** at `tests/contracts/external-integrations/` with an agentbox-emulator (ADR-10 R1). Each envelope variant round-trips; receiver structured-error responses asserted. Required for T7, CC-1, CC-15.
3. **CI drift checks**:
   - Route table drift (ADR-06 §D11 vs `App::new()`).
   - SQLite schema drift (`CREATE TABLE` only in ADR-11).
   - Class-bits invariant (mask coverage; TC-1).
   - Settings trait-surface SHA (TC-5).
   - Glossary first-use qualifier (CC-10).
   - Deprecated route names re-introduction (T6 / ADR-10 D7).
4. **Heartbeat-interval cancellation test** (T3 BDD-3).
5. **Class-bits unit test** (TC-1 mask coverage + round-trip).
6. **Trait-surface SHA test for `SettingsRepository`** (TC-5).
7. **Production-image WASM-artefact presence check** (CC-8).
8. **WireMock-style mapping table** for ACL wire→internal events (CC-1, used by Section 7 tests).
9. **Operator runbook** for audit-log retention (CC-12).
10. **PRD/ADR templates** at `docs/migration-sprint/_templates/` (CC-16).

## Coverage follow-ups (unowned surfaces)

These five surfaces surfaced during audit but are not owned by any
section as of this commit. They are listed here so the coordinator
does not lose them; each is targeted for resolution during the
affected section's implementation phase.

1. **Cloudflared tunnel ownership.** ADR-09 D12 punts to Section 6;
   ADR-06 currently has no tunnel section. Recommended owner: ADR-06
   (auth surface). Add a one-paragraph subsection covering tunnel
   config + secret rotation, or explicitly hand back to Section 9.
2. **`/auth/*` path roots inconsistency.** PRD-12 F2 / ADR-12 D8 use
   `/auth/challenge` and `/auth/verify`; ADR-06 D4 uses `/challenge`
   and `/session`. Reconcile to `/api/auth/*` in ADR-06 D4; ADR-12
   follows. Should be folded into T4's §D11 route enumeration when
   the BLOCKER lands.
3. **Migration tool fate post-cutover.** DDD-11 line 509 says
   removed from workspace; ADR-11 step 8 deletes only adapter files.
   Add an explicit "delete `tools/migrate-neo4j-to-oxigraph/` 14 days
   after cutover, after one successful re-run verifies the backup
   path" to ADR-11 §Implementation order.
4. **`computeEdgeLengths` consumer.** ADR-03 D7 surfaces it on the
   worker proxy's four-method surface; no section calls it. Verify
   during Section 3 implementation. If dead, drop from D7's surface
   (now three methods).
5. **NIP-98 canonical URL spec location.** ADR-06 D10 says client
   and server share `canonicalise_url` but the spec is in prose only.
   Promote the trailing-slash / param-order / fragment-handling rules
   to a numbered list inside D10; cite by anchor from D11's auth-bridge
   discussion.

## Style and structural observations

From CROSS-CUTTING.md §"Style / structural observations":

- Decision numbering (`D1, D2, …`) is consistent across all 11 ADRs.
- "Rejected from main as buggy / unjustified" and "Bugs and smells at the reset point" sub-sections are present and consistently labelled. Good.
- Cross-references mix `ADR-NN`, `Section N`, and full file paths. **Recommend** standardising on `ADR-NN §SS Decision DN` for in-prose refs; full path only in the `Related:` header.
- README phasing block lines 113-128 calls Phase 7 "parallel" — that is a cluster, not a phase. **Recommend** renaming to "Phase 7+: parallel work streams" or splitting into per-section phases. Combine with CC-7.
- Domain-event taxonomy is spread across DDD-01, DDD-07, DDD-08, DDD-11 (25+ events). **Recommend** a consolidated event reference table in README (producer × consumer × wire correspondence).
- PRD-11 reproduces a full SPARQL walkthrough that ADR-11 §D7 already covers. **Flag** for future trim (not urgent).
- No section has a "Test plan" / "Verifiability summary" mapping A-criteria to test classes. **Recommend** a §"Verification" in each ADR — required for the `/build-with-quality` pipeline to wire cleanly.

## Decision checkpoint

This document is the **single authority** for the resolutions above. Where the 12 sprint section docs (PRD/ADR/DDD) conflict with this document, **this document wins** until the proposed edits land in a follow-up commit titled `sprint: apply QE-fleet tension resolutions`.

Implementation MUST NOT begin for any BLOCKER-affected section until the resolutions land in the source docs:

- **TC-1** blocks Sections 2, 7, 8 — **and requires explicit human acceptance** that ADR-08 §D6's literal text was the inaccurate document (specialist conflict; T1's adjudication chosen on cost grounds).
- **T2** blocks Section 6 (Phase 2.5 work) and Section 2 (relies on `--allow-skip-auth`).
- **TC-5** blocks Sections 5, 6, 11.
- **T4** blocks Sections 2, 6, 7, 10, 12 (URL space + path corrections).
- **T7** blocks Sections 7 and 10 simultaneously (envelope is the contract between them).

**IMPORTANT-severity items** can be addressed during their owning section's implementation phase; they are not gating sprint kick-off. **NIT-severity items** clean up during implementation.

Once a project lead has confirmed TC-1's adjudication, this resolution set is ready to drive implementation.
