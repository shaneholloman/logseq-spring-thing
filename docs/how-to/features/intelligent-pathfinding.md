# Intelligent Pathfinding Guide

## Overview

Semantic pathfinding finds paths that are not just shortest, but most relevant to your query and graph semantics.

## Algorithms

### 1. Semantic Path (Enhanced A*)

Finds shortest path weighted by:
- Edge weights
- Node type compatibility
- Query relevance

```bash
POST /api/pathfinding/semantic-path
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "startId": 123,
  "endId": 456,
  "query": "machine learning projects"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "path": [123, 234, 345, 456],
  "cost": 3.2,
  "relevance": 0.87,
  "explanation": "Found path with 3 hops"
}
```

### 2. Query-Guided Traversal

Explores graph prioritizing nodes matching your query:

```bash
POST /api/pathfinding/query-traversal
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "startId": 123,
  "query": "artificial intelligence",
  "maxNodes": 50
}
```

Returns most relevant nodes, sorted by query match.

### 3. Chunk Traversal

Explores local neighborhood without query context:

```bash
POST /api/pathfinding/chunk-traversal
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "startId": 123,
  "maxNodes": 50
}
```

Finds similar nodes based on:
- Node type similarity
- Local structure
- Attribute similarity

## Configuration

### Pathfinding Parameters

```json
{
  "maxLength": 10,
  "maxExplored": 1000,
  "edgeWeightFactor": 0.4,
  "semanticWeightFactor": 0.4,
  "typeWeightFactor": 0.2
}
```

- `edgeWeightFactor`: How much edge weights matter (0.0-1.0)
- `semanticWeightFactor`: How much query relevance matters
- `typeWeightFactor`: How much type compatibility matters

## Use Cases

### Research Navigation

Find research papers related to query:
```
query: "neural networks"
→ Traverses to ML papers, AI researchers, related projects
```

### Dependency Analysis

Find critical dependencies:
```
query: "authentication security"
→ Paths weighted by security relevance
```

### Knowledge Discovery

Explore related concepts:
```
query: "quantum computing"
→ Discovers related papers, researchers, applications
```

## Performance

- **Semantic Path**: O(V log V) with semantic weighting
- **Query Traversal**: O(V + E) with relevance pruning
- **Chunk Traversal**: O(k * degree) for k nodes

Typical performance:
- 10K nodes: <100ms
- 100K nodes: <1s
- 1M nodes: <5s (with limits)

## Best Practices

1. **Set appropriate limits**: maxLength and maxExplored prevent long searches
2. **Use query context**: More specific queries = better results
3. **Choose right algorithm**:
   - Semantic Path: When you know start and end
   - Query Traversal: When exploring by topic
   - Chunk Traversal: When exploring local structure
4. **Combine with filters**: Use schema to filter node types first
5. **Cache results**: Common paths can be cached
