# INVALID FIXTURE

A BridgeRecord whose `vc:bridgeTo` targets a `LinkedPage` placeholder
is incoherent. Bridges connect concrete entities; a placeholder is by
definition unresolved. This is the most common author mistake — they
asserted the bridge in advance of the target's declaration. The
validator catches it because the target IRI has the `urn:visionclaw:linked:`
scheme which is reserved for placeholders.
