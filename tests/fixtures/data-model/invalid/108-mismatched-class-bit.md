# INVALID FIXTURE

The block declares `@type: OntologyClass` (class bit `0x04000000`) but
its `@id` is in the `urn:visionclaw:agent:` IRI scheme, which is
reserved for AgentTelemetry events (class bit `0x80000000`). The parser
cross-checks the IRI scheme against the type declaration and rejects
mismatches — otherwise the node would be misrouted at the named-graph
adapter and visibility would silently break.
