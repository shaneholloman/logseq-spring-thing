note:: This fixture represents a placeholder created by an unresolved wikilink. The placeholder will upgrade to OntologyClass once 010 / 012 are also ingested.

# LinkedPage Placeholder — Vitruvian Tradition

When a wikilink `[[Vitruvian Tradition]]` is encountered before any
declaration for that label, the parser creates a `LinkedPage`
placeholder. The placeholder has a `vc:slug`-derived IRI and an
`upgradedTo: null` field. On observation of a matching `OntologyClass`
declaration (anywhere in the corpus), the placeholder is upgraded
in-place and a `LinkResolved` event is emitted.

}
```

### Lifecycle note

If a future ingest run encounters an OntologyClass with `rdfs:label
"Vitruvian Tradition"`, the placeholder upgrades:

- The placeholder's `NodeId` sequence bits are preserved.
- The class bits flip from `0x08000000` (LinkedPage) to `0x04000000`
  (OntologyClass).
- A `LinkResolved` domain event is emitted.
- This placeholder record stays in the audit log but is excluded from
  the `GraphTopology` projection.
