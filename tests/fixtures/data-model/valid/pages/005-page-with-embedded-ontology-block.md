# Leon Battista Alberti

Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) was a Genoese-born humanist active in
Florence, Rimini, and Mantua. His treatise *De re aedificatoria* (1452,
printed 1485) is the first modern theoretical work on architecture and
established the discipline as a humanist art rather than a craft.

His built work includes the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] (Rimini, 1450),
[[Palazzo Rucellai]] (Florence, 1455), and the façade of [[Santa Maria Novella]]
(Florence, 1470).
