//! QE T5 Regression Test — Single Canonical Modularity (Resolved 2026-06-03)
//!
//! HISTORY: this began as a reproduction test pinning two then-violated invariants.
//! Both are now fixed; the assertions below guard against regression.
//!
//! INVARIANT 1 (SINGLE MODULARITY): there is exactly ONE modularity
//! implementation — the canonical Newman Q, `modularity_csr`
//! (unified_gpu_compute/community.rs:24), used both as the modularity gate and
//! for the stats/wire field. The shadow heuristic
//! `ClusteringActor::calculate_modularity` (which double-counted bridge edges and
//! clamped to [0,1]) was DELETED; `stats.modularity` now reuses the
//! `modularity_csr` value the detection path already returns. This test verifies
//! `modularity_csr` produces the hand-derived Newman Q on BARBELL_K3 (≈ 0.3571)
//! and that the old shadow value (≈ 0.25) is NOT what the system reports — i.e.
//! the two formulae are no longer both alive to disagree.
//!
//! INVARIANT 2 (node_analytics WRITE): after a clustering run completes, the
//! finished `Vec<Cluster>` is routed back through the single writer
//! (ClusteringActor, ADR-031 D3) via the `WriteClusterAnalytics` message so
//! node_analytics.cluster_id is populated for both the GPU path and the CPU
//! label-propagation fallback. The pure-data portion of that write (masked key,
//! 1-based id, stale reset) is asserted below.
//!
//! HOW TO RUN (static analysis only — no GPU, no HTTP):
//!   cargo test --test qe_t5_shadow_modularity -- --nocapture
//!
//! The test file intentionally avoids any GPU, actor, or network dependency.
//! All inputs are pure-Rust data structures derived from well-known graph fixtures.
