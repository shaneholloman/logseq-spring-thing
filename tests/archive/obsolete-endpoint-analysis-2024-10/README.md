# Obsolete Endpoint Analysis Documentation

**Archived**: 2026-01-12
**Original Location**: `/tests/endpoint-analysis/`
**Reason**: References deprecated SQLite database architecture

## Contents

These documents were created during October 2024 endpoint testing and reference the **SQLite database architecture** which has since been replaced by **Neo4j**.

### Files Archived

1. `ARCHITECTURE_DISCOVERY.md` - Backend architecture findings (SQLite references)
2. `COMPLETE_TEST_REPORT.md` - Full analysis of endpoint tests
3. `COMPREHENSIVE_FINDINGS.md` - Testing findings summary
4. `DATABASE_LOCATIONS.md` - Database locations (SQLite paths)
5. `FINAL_TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Final test summary
6. `HANDOFF_TO_DEBUGGING_AGENT.md` - Debugging handoff document
7. `REVISED_FINDINGS.md` - Revised testing findings

## Current Architecture

VisionClaw now uses:
- **Database**: Neo4j 5.13 (replaced SQLite)
- **Persistence**: Server-authoritative with Neo4j as single source of truth
- **Handler locations**: Same as documented, but database operations differ
